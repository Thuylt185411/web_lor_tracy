A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,-1,13.0,(futuristic chiming)
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,10,17.0,"- At first, you wouldn't notice anything,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,14,23.0,"and then, suddenly everything would change"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,20,28.0,radically and violently.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,25,32.0,Imagine yourself 500 years in the future.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,29,33.0,You're sitting in a ship
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,30,37.0,"zipping through the silent, empty void of outer space."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,34,41.0,You're traveling to explore a black hole up close
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,38,45.0,for the first time in human history.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,42,47.0,You're very lucky to be able to do this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,44,48.0,"For centuries,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,45,51.0,the prospect of traveling to a black hole was absurd.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,48,52.0,The closest one is nearly
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,49,54.0,"60 million billion kilometers away,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,51,57.0,but great advancements were made in space travel
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,54,60.0,"and cryogenics, and here you are,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,57,64.0,"you're traveling to explore a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,61,70.0,"and you're about to make a very big mistake,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,67,72.0,but we're getting ahead of ourselves.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,69,77.0,"What is a black hole, really?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,74,80.0,Everyone here is either sitting down or standing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,77,82.0,A couple of people are standing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,79,84.0,"That might not sound like a profound statement,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,81,87.0,"but cosmically, it is."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,84,89.0,"And if you're watching this video afterwards, chances are,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,86,91.0,"you know, maybe at the home or the office,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,88,94.0,chances are you're standing at a table or sitting
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,91,96.0,"on a chair, or perhaps lying on a sofa."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,93,98.0,"No matter who you are, no matter your gender or skin color,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,95,102.0,you all have one very important thing in common.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,99,107.0,You're not currently floating around the room.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,104,109.0,Why are you not floating?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,106,112.0,"Because of gravity, of course."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,109,114.0,Gravity is the force of attraction
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,111,116.0,"between any two big objects,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,113,117.0,"like between the moon and the earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,114,121.0,"between the earth and you, but behind that"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,118,125.0,simple statement lies a series of very profound insights
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,122,128.0,that require us to completely change our understanding
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,125,131.0,of the fabric of reality.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,128,133.0,So the ultimate question underneath it all
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,130,137.0,is what causes gravity?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,134,140.0,"So physics, as you know, this is the type of question,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,137,141.0,what causes gravity?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,138,143.0,This is the type of question that keeps physicists up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,140,146.0,"at night because physics is, among other things,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,143,149.0,"as you know, the search for mechanisms, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,146,152.0,reasons or explanations for why certain things
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,149,155.0,"happen the way they do, the why and the how."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,152,157.0,And if a physicist comes to you
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,154,161.0,"and asks you what causes X phenomenon, and you tell her,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,158,163.0,"that's just the way it is,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,160,167.0,she'll be very dissatisfied with your answer.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,164,169.0,"And so for the longest time, the question,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,166,174.0,what causes gravity was not so well understood.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,171,175.0,"And even, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,172,178.0,"a fairly bright guy known as Isaac Newton,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,175,181.0,"even Isaac Newton, someone who managed"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,178,184.0,"to describe gravity quite well in the 1600s,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,181,187.0,"even Isaac Newton at some point had to admit,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,184,189.0,"I don't know what's going on, so in the Scholium General,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,186,192.0,"he says, ""I have not as yet been able to discover"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,189,195.0,"the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,192,198.0,"and I do not feign hypotheses."""
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,195,201.0,"He's saying, yeah, my equations work really, really well,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,198,204.0,"but the why, I have no idea why."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,201,206.0,"And for the long time people would say, okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,203,208.0,"well, maybe gravity is just like a universal force,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,205,210.0,and that's just always been the way it is.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,207,211.0,"And if you think about that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,208,214.0,"that's a little bit too close to, that's just the way it is."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,211,218.0,It is not satisfying at all.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,215,219.0,And so what is that?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,216,222.0,What is the mechanism that keeps you seated in your chair
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,219,226.0,and that keeps the moon orbiting around the earth like that?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,223,228.0,"For the longest time, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,225,231.0,this was not understood until Albert Einstein
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,228,233.0,"and Albert Einstein needs no introduction,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,230,236.0,"in 1915, he finally came up with general relativity,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,233,238.0,"a general theory of relativity,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,235,239.0,and came up with a mechanism
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,236,243.0,that explained how gravity actually works.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,240,246.0,And it required us to completely change our perspective
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,243,248.0,on the nature of reality.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,245,252.0,"And so, the question is, for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,249,253.0,"when an apple falls from a tree,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,250,257.0,what is the apple falling through?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,254,258.0,"Okay, the atmosphere."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,255,262.0,"So maybe that's a bad example, but what about the moon?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,259,265.0,What is the moon falling through?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,262,266.0,"Not really anything, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,263,268.0,But it's falling through empty space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,265,271.0,But what is space?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,268,274.0,"Again, the concept of space for a very long time"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,271,276.0,"was this notion that it was sort of like, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,273,278.0,"there's different ways that people thought about it, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,275,280.0,"But the concept of space, for a very long time,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,277,283.0,you could think of it as the sort of background grid
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,280,285.0,"upon which things happen, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,282,289.0,"So the space is not real in the sense of,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,286,291.0,"you know, like a moon or the earth or you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,288,293.0,"like a table or something like that, but if I want to,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,290,295.0,I can impose a grid upon it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,292,297.0,So then I can describe things in the physical world
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,294,299.0,"in a better way, in a more convenient way, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,296,302.0,"So I can impose a grid, like for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,299,303.0,lines on a chalkboard.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,300,305.0,"If I wanna make a grid so that I can better describe some,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,302,307.0,"you know, planets that are doing something with arrows."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,304,308.0,"I don't know what that was,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,305,312.0,I just decided to draw it in the moment's notice.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,309,314.0,"But you know, that grid is there"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,311,315.0,"to help me with my calculations, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,312,317.0,"And you know, it's sort of like an abstract thing,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,314,319.0,"and it's so abstract that if I wanted to,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,316,321.0,I could actually choose a different coordinate system
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,318,323.0,"if I wanted to, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,320,327.0,"And as long as I am consistent about what I'm talking about,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,324,329.0,"then it's totally gonna be okay, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,326,332.0,"And we'll let this guy finish his work here, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,329,334.0,"Great, very good."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,331,335.0,"Oh, that's good too. Oh, beautiful."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,332,338.0,He's an artist.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,335,341.0,"But again, so, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,338,344.0,so space in a sense is this background grid.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,341,346.0,It's like these this metric lines
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,343,347.0,"that we impose upon things,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,344,349.0,so that then we can describe physical phenomena
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,346,350.0,that are going inside.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,347,351.0,But it's not real.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,348,355.0,"It's not as though I, like, draw a circle on the blackboard,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,352,357.0,it's gonna change the blackboard or the blackboard itself
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,354,359.0,doesn't change the circle.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,356,362.0,"But in fact, so you might think that space"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,359,363.0,"is like that, space is nothing."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,360,366.0,It's just some sort of like a background thing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,363,368.0,It turns out that Einstein pointed out
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,365,370.0,that this is absolutely not the case.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,367,372.0,"Einstein pointed out that in fact,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,369,374.0,there's a completely wildly different way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,371,375.0,to think about it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,372,377.0,"In fact, the way that gravity arises,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,374,379.0,"the way that gravity comes into existence,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,376,381.0,the way that the force of gravity arises
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,378,382.0,"is due to the presence,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,379,385.0,the fact that a presence of a certain amount
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,382,387.0,of stuff within a certain volume of space
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,384,392.0,actually warps and bends the fabric of space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,389,394.0,"So in that sense, space is actually something malleable."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,391,397.0,"It's bendable, and this is a completely,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,394,398.0,this was a completely different way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,395,400.0,of thinking about the world.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,397,402.0,"It was not just a, you know, a small step forward."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,399,404.0,It's a complete sea change
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,401,406.0,with the way we understand the world.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,403,408.0,"And so now, because of that, so for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,405,410.0,"if I put something that has a certain density,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,407,412.0,"so that you can think of space in this sense as more like a,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,409,414.0,"instead of just a completely empty space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,411,416.0,"it's more like a rubber sheet, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,413,418.0,"And if I put like something heavy on the rubber sheet,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,415,420.0,it actually deforms the sheet.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,417,421.0,"If I have nothing there,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,418,424.0,"the regular rubber sheet, and we're all stretching it tight,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,421,426.0,"if I flick a little marble across there,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,423,428.0,"the marble goes in a straight line, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,425,430.0,"But if I put something heavy there,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,427,432.0,"like a bowling ball or this yellow thing, and then if I,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,429,434.0,"now if I push something,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,431,437.0,"if I flick a little marble or something, it actually,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,434,438.0,"from the marble's perspective,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,435,440.0,it's going in a straight line.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,437,442.0,"But from a larger perspective,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,439,444.0,it's actually falling toward the thing
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,441,447.0,that is curving the fabric of space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,444,449.0,This was a wildly different way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,446,451.0,of thinking about the universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,448,454.0,"So therefore, we have our mechanism, the moon and the earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,451,456.0,"for example, orbit around each other"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,453,459.0,"because each one is falling into constantly this,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,456,462.0,the curved spacetime of the other
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,459,463.0,due to the presence of energy
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,460,466.0,and matter density in space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,463,467.0,"This is just mind boggling, you know?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,464,470.0,"And it still is to me, and it was at the time too."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,467,471.0,"So this was a very,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,468,477.0,very radically different way of thinking about the world.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,474,481.0,"But it gets worse because it turns out that not,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,478,484.0,"the space is not just bendable, it doesn't just bend,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,481,487.0,it actually flows too.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,484,489.0,Space is something that actually can move.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,486,491.0,Parts of space can actually move
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,488,493.0,compared to other parts of space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,490,496.0,"And this has wild consequences, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,493,498.0,"So what that means is that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,495,500.0,so this is basically comes out of the equations
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,497,502.0,"of general relativity, so if you have something"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,499,503.0,"that has a lot of gravity,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,500,505.0,you can actually have space that's bending.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,502,507.0,It creates a kind of a sinkhole in space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,504,509.0,But if there's a lot of stuff packed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,506,510.0,"into a small enough volume,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,507,512.0,space itself starts to flow
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,509,515.0,toward the center of that volume.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,512,517.0,"So for example, if you have the sun,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,514,518.0,it has a certain amount of density.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,515,520.0,"The denser the object, the deeper the sinkhole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,517,522.0,"and the more the space starts to bend toward,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,519,525.0,starts to flow toward the center of this volume.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,522,529.0,"So the sun, for example, warps spacetime a certain way."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,526,532.0,You can think about the extent to which this space
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,529,534.0,is flowing toward the center of any of these objects
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,531,537.0,in the sense of how fast you would have to go
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,534,540.0,"to get away from the surface of one of these things, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,537,543.0,"So for example, if you wanted to get away from the earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,540,545.0,"you know, we know that you have to go pretty fast"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,542,546.0,"to get away from the surface of the earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,543,549.0,"but we know that it can be done, obviously."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,546,551.0,"If you wanted to get away from the sun,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,548,555.0,you'd have to travel 50 or 60 times faster than that.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,552,557.0,"And if you wanted to get away from a neutron star,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,554,559.0,you need to travel at something like 60%
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,556,561.0,of the speed of light.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,558,565.0,Given the fact that my astrophysics colleagues
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,562,568.0,estimate that the fastest speed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,565,570.0,that a human could possibly go without getting killed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,567,572.0,"is something about half the speed of light,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,569,575.0,"and as humans, the fastest we've ever gone in anything,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,572,579.0,"I think was something like 0.00001% of the speed of light,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,576,581.0,you're not gonna get away from a neutron star
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,578,583.0,with our current technology.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,580,584.0,But think about what this means.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,581,587.0,"If you take this to its logical conclusion, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,584,589.0,"if I take a certain amount of stuff in space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,586,592.0,it bends space and space starts to flow a certain amount.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,589,595.0,"If I put more stuff into its fixed volume,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,592,598.0,starts to bend and flow even more.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,595,599.0,Take that to its logical conclusion.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,596,603.0,"If I put too much stuff into a fixed space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,600,606.0,space will bend and flow so quickly into the center
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,603,608.0,"that no matter how fast I move,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,605,611.0,I'll never be able to escape this flow.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,608,614.0,And this is our black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,611,617.0,"You can think of a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,614,619.0,like an extremely strong water drain
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,616,624.0,where the water is the fabric of space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,621,627.0,Imagine you're a fish in the water.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,624,628.0,"If you get too close to the drain,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,625,630.0,the water will flow in inward
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,627,632.0,faster than you can ever possibly swim.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,629,636.0,"And even if you swim at your fastest possible speed,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,633,638.0,you'll be sucked into the drain.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,635,641.0,"Likewise, if you stay far enough"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,638,643.0,"away from a black hole in space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,640,644.0,"you're okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,641,647.0,"but there's a point of no return called the event horizon,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,644,651.0,beyond which space is flowing into the center of the object
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,648,654.0,faster than the speed of light.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,651,658.0,So not even light can escape from inside of this black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,655,659.0,"But if that's the case,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,656,661.0,"and so you've probably heard these things,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,658,662.0,"I understand that for the last, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,659,663.0,"10 minutes or something,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,660,664.0,I've been saying things that a lot of you have heard
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,661,668.0,"a million times before, but what does that really mean?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,665,671.0,Like if that means that space is flowing faster
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,668,673.0,"than the speed of light inside this black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,670,676.0,"beyond this event horizon, this point of no return,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,673,677.0,what does that really mean?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,674,682.0,What's actually going on inside of a black hole?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,679,685.0,That's the zillion dollar question.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,682,686.0,"If you can find the answer to that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,683,689.0,"you will have about 10 Nobel prizes, I think."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,686,692.0,So two things probably jumped out
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,689,693.0,"at you when you see an image like this,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,690,695.0,"a gift like this, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,692,697.0,"So the first thing is that thing in the middle,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,694,699.0,a singularity.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,696,701.0,"So you probably heard the word singularity before,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,698,702.0,"but in a physics sense,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,699,705.0,what this means is that there's a point in space
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,702,708.0,where you have infinite density
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,705,711.0,and infinite curvature of space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,708,714.0,"I don't know about you, but I have no idea what that means."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,711,716.0,"And I'm a physicist,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,713,719.0,"so I have no idea what it means to have actually to,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,716,721.0,"you know, to actualize that in the real world."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,718,723.0,What does it mean to have a point that has infinite density
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,720,727.0,and an infinite curvature of space?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,724,728.0,Probably what this means
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,725,729.0,is that there's something we're missing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,726,732.0,So if you look closely at the mathematics
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,729,733.0,"of general relativity,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,730,736.0,"and you should always look closely at the mathematics,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,733,738.0,you see these things like singularities
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,735,741.0,that jump out in the equations like this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,738,743.0,And typically when you have something that shows up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,740,746.0,"in your equations that makes no physical sense,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,743,749.0,that's typically the universe's way of telling you
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,746,750.0,to think a little bit harder
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,747,751.0,and that you're missing something.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,748,753.0,There's something that needs to be put in to avoid
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,750,755.0,these sort of catastrophic nonsense things.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,752,758.0,So the other thing you probably noticed about this
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,755,761.0,"is that inside the event horizon of a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,758,765.0,"if space is flowing faster than the speed of light,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,762,767.0,if you went to travel to a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,764,769.0,"to study it up close, and you should definitely"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,766,771.0,"want to do this 'cause it would be amazing,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,768,773.0,you probably should stay away from the event horizon
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,770,776.0,"because if you went inside,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,773,779.0,there's no way for you to ever tell the rest of us
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,776,781.0,what you learned because there's no way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,778,785.0,for you to send a signal outside of the event horizon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,782,788.0,It's a one-way trip into a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,785,791.0,"So that's the two things that you probably have,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,788,792.0,"you know, that have jumped away from you."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,789,794.0,"So again, if you wanted to go to a black hole"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,791,795.0,"to study it up close,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,792,797.0,"and you should definitely want to do that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,794,804.0,you definitely wanna stay away from the event horizon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,801,805.0,"And the first reason, of course,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,802,807.0,"is that scientific reason, like I said."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,804,809.0,"You would be a very, very bad scientist"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,806,812.0,if you go one way into a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,809,813.0,and you could never send your data back
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,810,815.0,"to the rest of the community, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,812,817.0,"That's a very, you're being a bad scientific, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,814,820.0,bad scientist for the community.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,817,822.0,But the second reason you would want to stay away
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,819,826.0,is actually existential because the conditions
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,823,829.0,inside of a black hole are such that
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,826,831.0,the gravitational conditions will be such that
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,828,834.0,"it's likely with a certain size of black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,831,836.0,"it's likely that if you go into a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,833,839.0,"the gravitational force on, say your feet, will be much,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,836,841.0,much different from the force on your head.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,838,843.0,"And you might get stretched into spaghetti,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,840,845.0,"so for example, the fish in the water drain,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,842,847.0,"if a fish got too close to a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,844,850.0,it would probably be stretched into something resembling
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,847,852.0,fish spaghetti very quickly.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,849,853.0,"So existentially,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,850,855.0,you'd wanna stay away from the black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,852,856.0,as much as you could.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,853,859.0,"So, but that's for black holes of a certain size."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,856,860.0,"So for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,857,862.0,a smaller black holes or kind of medium-sized black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,859,863.0,"Yeah, the gravitational conditions"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,860,865.0,as you go in will be so violent
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,862,868.0,and so crazy that they would probably rip you apart
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,865,869.0,or stretch you into spaghetti like this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,866,873.0,"But there's a big caveat here,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,870,874.0,and we'll get to that in a moment.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,871,877.0,"But the other thing you should be asking yourself is, okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,874,878.0,"the thing I mentioned, and anytime"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,875,880.0,your mathematics tells you something
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,877,882.0,that's sort of nonsensical
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,879,883.0,"and doesn't make any sense, and you're like,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,880,885.0,"wait a minute, this probably doesn't exist in the universe,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,882,887.0,"the singularity, you should also ask,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,884,890.0,do we really know that black holes exist?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,887,892.0,Maybe this is just some kind of nonsensical thing
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,889,895.0,"that pop outta some equations that humans are using,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,892,899.0,but nature wisely avoids using because it makes no sense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,896,901.0,So it's not just a mathematical oddity
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,898,903.0,that our universe avoids.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,900,905.0,Black holes were a prediction for many years.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,902,907.0,"So take, go back to 1915,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,904,910.0,like 10 years before Einstein had completely changed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,907,913.0,"everything with special relativity, Brownian motion,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,910,915.0,"all these things, everybody's going crazy."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,912,917.0,"Then 1915, everything changed again."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,914,920.0,The guy completely ruined all of everyone's perceptions
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,917,923.0,about the universe twice within 10 years.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,920,925.0,So people were catching up with this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,922,927.0,"And some of these first predictions that were coming out,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,924,928.0,they didn't make a lot of sense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,925,930.0,"People were like, okay, we need to check this thing,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,927,931.0,we need to check this thing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,928,933.0,And there's also this solution that you found
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,930,937.0,"that led to this concept, this object known as a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,934,938.0,which is very scary and weird.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,935,939.0,"And for a long time,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,936,940.0,"for decades, people were like, okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,937,942.0,"well, that's sort of an odd thing,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,939,943.0,"maybe, you know, I don't know"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,940,945.0,"how we're gonna detect one of those things,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,942,947.0,"so maybe we'll see those in a, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,944,949.0,in a few years or something.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,946,951.0,So it was a very strange prediction for decades
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,948,954.0,and decades until the 1960s
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,951,956.0,"when in the sixties and seventies,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,953,959.0,astronomers noticed something weird going on
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,956,963.0,"near Cygnus X-1, and if you can't spot the black hole"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,960,966.0,"on this object, you should not be feel bad"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,963,969.0,because that's where the black hole is hiding.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,966,972.0,There's a black hole hiding in that light spot.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,969,977.0,So Cygnus X-1 is a double system.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,974,978.0,"There's a black hole with a blue giant,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,975,981.0,super giant star next to it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,978,983.0,And this is an artist's rendition
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,980,985.0,of what Cygnus X-1 looks like.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,982,987.0,So it really is this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,984,988.0,"And in fact, in the sixties and seventies,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,985,991.0,"astronomers started to see these hot,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,988,994.0,these extremely energetic x-rays and gamma rays
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,991,997.0,that are coming away from this thing
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,994,998.0,"that wasn't radiating itself,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,995,1000.0,but it seemed to be eating another star
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,997,1001.0,that was next to it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,998,1004.0,And these signals matched almost exactly
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1001,1007.0,what you would expect from a black hole doing this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1004,1009.0,"So this is an artist rendition, of course."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1006,1013.0,"You might also ask, okay, this is just one example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1010,1014.0,"but we also know that we can,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1011,1017.0,"so we can't actually see black holes directly, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1014,1019.0,"because no light can emerge from them,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1016,1023.0,"but we can see other stars orbiting completely dark,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1020,1025.0,empty spots in space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1022,1026.0,There's obviously something going on there
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1023,1029.0,"in the middle though, even though, in the middle there,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1026,1032.0,even though there's no star that you can see.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1029,1035.0,"And as of, so the evidence for black holes"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1032,1036.0,is mounting and mounting.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1033,1038.0,"And as you know, as of 2019,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1035,1041.0,we can actually see the hot gas
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1038,1045.0,from around a black hole as it's being twisted
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1042,1046.0,"around this black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1043,1048.0,and this is from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1045,1051.0,"from 2019, one of the most amazing images"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1048,1053.0,that humankind has ever produced.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1050,1057.0,"And this is an M87, 55 million light years away."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1054,1060.0,"So black holes are really real indeed,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1057,1063.0,and they're not even that rare.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1060,1065.0,"You know, it's strange because the universe"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1062,1068.0,seems to love these twisted vortices.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1065,1069.0,"There's,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1066,1070.0,(clears throat)
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1067,1072.0,there's a big one in the center
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1069,1076.0,of nearly every large galaxy we've seen and our own.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1073,1079.0,And in fact the closest confirmed black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1076,1083.0,"is that Cygnus X-1, which is about 6,000 light years away."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1080,1086.0,Given the fact that our Milky Way is about
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1083,1089.0,"100,000 light years across, 6,000 light years"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1086,1092.0,is not that far away.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1089,1094.0,Our Milky Way seems to be sprinkled
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1091,1096.0,with smaller black holes as well.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1093,1101.0,"And there even could be a mysterious black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1098,1106.0,even shockingly closer to earth.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1103,1108.0,"In the outer edges of our solar system,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1105,1113.0,several big rocks seem to be orbiting in strange ways.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1110,1115.0,"Some astronomers think there's a new planet,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1112,1117.0,"Planet 9, that could be responsible"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1114,1119.0,"for these wobbly odd orbits,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1116,1123.0,but we see no evidence of a visible planet.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1120,1126.0,"So what if it's not, the reason we haven't seen it"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1123,1128.0,"is that it's not a planet,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1125,1136.0,but in fact is a tiny black hole about the size of an apple
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1133,1138.0,that was born just a little bit after the universe
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1135,1141.0,"was formed 13.8 billion years ago,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1138,1145.0,and then floated around our universe for billions of years
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1142,1149.0,before finally getting stuck in our solar system.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1146,1153.0,"So an apple-sized black hole, heads up."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1150,1155.0,"(attendee catches apple, audience chuckle)"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1152,1156.0,"So an apple-sized, oh,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1153,1157.0,and I wanted to show you this thing too.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1154,1160.0,So actually a couple of the physicists
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1157,1161.0,"that proposed this idea,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1158,1164.0,because some other physicists that I know came up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1161,1166.0,"with the idea that maybe there's a Planet 9,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1163,1168.0,"then some other physicists that I know, Jakub Scholtz,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1165,1169.0,"this guy, he's like, well, wait a minute,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1166,1171.0,what if it's actually a black hole?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1168,1173.0,"In their paper, if you go to their paper"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1170,1175.0,"in the auxiliary supplementary material,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1172,1177.0,that's typically the place in a paper
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1174,1178.0,"where you put like really,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1175,1180.0,really detailed calculations that nobody
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1177,1181.0,"wants to deal with here, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1178,1184.0,"or like the extra part of your data, the copious list,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1181,1185.0,so in case somebody wants to replicate what you did.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1182,1187.0,It's the really boring part of the paper.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1184,1190.0,These guys decided to put a life-sized version
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1187,1192.0,of what the black hole would look like.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1189,1193.0,"So this is, if you printed the paper"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1190,1197.0,"that's right there on the page, it's quite cool."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1194,1200.0,"So an apple-sized black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1197,1205.0,could you make a black hole yourself?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1202,1208.0,"So if you want to know what it takes to make a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1205,1210.0,just grab your textbook on gravity.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1207,1212.0,I assume you all have a textbook on gravity
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1209,1215.0,on your bedside table like I do.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1212,1217.0,And find the black hole equation.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1214,1220.0,"It'll tell you for some given amount of mass,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1217,1223.0,how small of a volume you have to pack it in
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1220,1225.0,to make a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1222,1228.0,"For example, to make a black hole out of the earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1225,1230.0,you need to pack the entire thing into a volume
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1227,1235.0,about the size of a blueberry.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1232,1236.0,"Most black holes we know of, of course,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1233,1240.0,"are much larger than this, with masses, for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1237,1243.0,"the one in the center of our galaxy has a volume,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1240,1245.0,"yeah, I think a diameter that's something like"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1242,1247.0,1/3 of the distance between the earth and the sun.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1244,1250.0,But with a mass that's like several million times
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1247,1251.0,that of the sun.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1248,1254.0,"And there are much, much larger black holes out there too,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1251,1255.0,"with masses that are billions,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1252,1257.0,tens of billions of times that of the sun
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1254,1259.0,and with volumes that will encompass
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1256,1262.0,our entire solar system.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1259,1264.0,But it's really actually that easy.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1261,1265.0,The equation is fun.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1262,1267.0,We can actually do some fun things with this equation.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1264,1269.0,We could just take any mass and look at it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1266,1270.0,So this is our equation.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1267,1273.0,Let's imagine we wanted to make a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1270,1275.0,out of a proton.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1272,1277.0,"A proton is already very, very small,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1274,1280.0,"10 to the power of minus 15 meters,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1277,1282.0,"completely diminishing already, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1279,1286.0,"If you wanted to make a black hole out of a proton,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1283,1288.0,"you need to pack it into a volume that's 10 billion,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1285,1292.0,billion times smaller than the Planck length.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1289,1295.0,Given that the Planck length is the smallest physically
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1292,1297.0,meaningful distance that quantum mechanics
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1294,1300.0,"allows us to define, a proton is safe."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1297,1303.0,You're never gonna make a black hole out of a proton.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1300,1305.0,What about you?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1302,1307.0,Can we make a black hole out of you?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1304,1309.0,"If you wanna make a black hole out of you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1306,1310.0,we would need to pack you into a volume
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1307,1315.0,that's one ten-billionth the size of a proton.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1312,1318.0,Given that this is a thousand times smaller than the current
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1315,1320.0,"most powerful distance resolution on earth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1317,1323.0,"which is the Large Hadron Collider, you are also safe."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1320,1327.0,We're not gonna make a black hole out of you.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1324,1329.0,What about the sun?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1326,1331.0,"If you wanna make a black hole out of the sun,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1328,1333.0,"you'd have to smash it into a diameter,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1330,1336.0,into a sphere that has a diameter that goes from about
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1333,1338.0,Westminster Abbey to Dalston.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1335,1340.0,"Okay, so I know that sometimes during, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1337,1342.0,"high tourist season,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1339,1344.0,Trafalgar Square gets so dense that it sort of seems
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1341,1345.0,"like it would make a black hole, but no,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1342,1347.0,"it's not ever gonna be close to the volume,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1344,1350.0,"the density you'd need to make a black hole like, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1347,1353.0,packing the entire sun into Dalston.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1350,1355.0,What about something really big?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1352,1361.0,What about the observable universe?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1358,1365.0,"So recall that space bends and flows, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1362,1366.0,We established that earlier.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1363,1369.0,We know that space is not something that's static.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1366,1371.0,It actually is malleable and it bends and it flows.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1368,1373.0,This happens also on large scales.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1370,1376.0,You may have heard the statement a zillion times before.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1373,1378.0,"The universe is expanding, and it's true,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1375,1380.0,"we know that the universe is expanding,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1377,1383.0,but expanding into what?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1380,1384.0,Nothing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1381,1387.0,Space itself is expanding.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1384,1390.0,"For example, two galaxies in our solar system,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1387,1392.0,"or sorry, two galaxies in our universe"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1389,1394.0,are like two pins stuck into this rubber sheet.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1391,1397.0,Then the rubber sheet is being pulled from all directions.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1394,1399.0,"From this perspective of an ant on the sheet,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1396,1402.0,nothing happened to make the pins move.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1399,1405.0,"Space itself is moving, the sheet,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1402,1406.0,and the distance between them is increasing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1403,1409.0,"So we know that this is happening to our universe,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1406,1413.0,"and because of that, we also know that the particular way,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1410,1416.0,"so, you know, for example, if you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1413,1417.0,because of the particular way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1414,1419.0,"that the universe expanded right at its birth,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1416,1421.0,we also know that there are parts
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1418,1424.0,of the universe that are currently unobservable to us.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1421,1428.0,They are outside of the so-called observable universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1425,1431.0,This is a consequence of the way that universe expanded
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1428,1432.0,"right at the moment to the Big Bang,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1429,1434.0,"right before the moment to the Big Bang, in fact."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1431,1436.0,So there are parts of the universe that are so far away
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1433,1439.0,"that we can't see them, okay?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1436,1443.0,So the observable universe is defined as this sphere
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1440,1444.0,that's around you.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1441,1446.0,"Every single one of you in fact has a slightly,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1443,1448.0,slightly different observable universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1445,1452.0,There's a sphere around you that's composed of all the stuff
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1449,1454.0,that has had a chance to send a light signal
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1451,1456.0,that you could receive.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1453,1457.0,"But beyond that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1454,1461.0,we have no idea how big the entire universe is.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1458,1464.0,So the observable universe right now is 93 billion
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1461,1466.0,light years in diameter.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1463,1469.0,"But the entire universe, we have no clue."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1466,1470.0,"It could be infinite, in fact,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1467,1473.0,"it could be something smaller, we don't know."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1470,1474.0,"So we can't,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1471,1476.0,it's very difficult to estimate the amount of stuff
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1473,1479.0,"that's in their entire universe, but, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1476,1481.0,"my astrophysics, physics colleagues are quite good."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1478,1483.0,We can estimate the amount of stuff
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1480,1486.0,"that's in the observable universe, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1483,1487.0,So if we take all the stuff
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1484,1489.0,"that's in the observable universe, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1486,1491.0,"we add up all the protons, all the neutrons,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1488,1492.0,"all the electrons,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1489,1495.0,"all the stuff that makes up you and me and potatoes,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1492,1498.0,and then we also add up all of the neutrinos.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1495,1501.0,Every single one of you has about 10 trillion neutrinos
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1498,1504.0,from the sun zooming through your thumb every second.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1501,1506.0,"We add up all of these particles as well,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1503,1508.0,and we add up all the dark matter and we add up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1505,1511.0,"all the photons and we add up all the gravitational waves,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1508,1513.0,we get an enormous number.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1510,1515.0,"We get something that the universe is probably,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1512,1517.0,the estimated total mass is something like
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1514,1521.0,10 to the power of 54 kilograms.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1518,1523.0,"Then if we look into what this, so, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1520,1525.0,"we just use this equation,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1522,1527.0,we can figure out what it would take to make a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1524,1530.0,out of the entire observable universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1527,1532.0,"And if you do this calculation,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1529,1537.0,you find that it would take a diameter
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1534,1540.0,that's three times the diameter
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1537,1544.0,of the current observable universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1541,1546.0,Let me double check my calculation here.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1543,1548.0,(audience laugh)
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1545,1552.0,"Okay, so, okay, so, okay, astrophysical numbers are,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1549,1554.0,"you know, subject to uncertainties,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1551,1555.0,maybe we got the number a little bit wrong.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1552,1557.0,So let's imagine that even the number is twice
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1554,1560.0,as much as the estimate here.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1557,1563.0,Let's imagine that in fact the universe is something like
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1560,1566.0,"10, you know, five times 10 to the power 53,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1563,1567.0,it's half of what we thought it was.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1564,1569.0,"This will make more sense, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1566,1571.0,So then if you wanted to make a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1568,1573.0,"out of the entire observable universe,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1570,1577.0,you need to pack it into a sphere that's about
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1574,1587.0,a little larger than the current observable universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1584,1600.0,Do we live inside an enormous black hole?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1597,1603.0,"When I first came across this calculation,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1600,1606.0,I was dumbfounded.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1603,1607.0,It made no sense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1604,1610.0,"Is it possible that the interior,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1607,1612.0,that our entire universe is the interior
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1609,1616.0,of an enormous black hole?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1613,1617.0,"I mean, it doesn't make any sense"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1614,1618.0,"because I thought that black hole's, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1615,1620.0,"from science fiction, these twisted vortices"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1617,1623.0,"that suck in entire stars and they make, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1620,1625.0,"Christopher Nolan movies crazy, you know, things like that."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1622,1628.0,So I thought that's what black holes were.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1625,1630.0,And this made no sense to me.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1627,1633.0,"It turns out that it depends upon,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1630,1634.0,"so, you know, I thought that it makes no sense"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1631,1636.0,that we would be inside of a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1633,1637.0,"because you would just get twisted,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1634,1640.0,"you would get torn to shreds, just like we talked about."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1637,1644.0,"It turns out that as long as the black hole is large enough,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1641,1646.0,you would be okay.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1643,1650.0,You would be okay inside the event horizon of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1647,1652.0,"So it depends on the size, so, you know, for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1649,1655.0,if you happen to fall into a black hole that was the size
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1652,1657.0,"of the one that would go around London, the solar mass,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1654,1658.0,"black hole within, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1655,1661.0,"from Westminster Abbey to Dalston, you'd have no chance."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1658,1663.0,"You would be ripped to shreds immediately,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1660,1667.0,"but with a large enough black hole, you'd be okay."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1664,1670.0,It would still be a one-way trip.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1667,1671.0,"Once you cross this event horizon,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1668,1674.0,there's no way for you to go back out.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1671,1678.0,But it's entirely possible that our observable universe
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1675,1684.0,right now exists on the interior of an enormous black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1681,1688.0,"This is very weird, I admit,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1685,1694.0,but black holes are more than astrophysical oddities.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1691,1695.0,"If you think about it,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1692,1697.0,they're actually profound statements
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1694,1702.0,about the limitations of knowledge.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1699,1704.0,So what is a black hole actually doing?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1701,1707.0,"Think about what it does, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1704,1709.0,"A black hole separates the world,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1706,1712.0,"separates the physical world into two regions, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1709,1714.0,You have the inside the black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1711,1716.0,and you have outside the black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1713,1720.0,"And this event horizon becomes a barrier, a border,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1717,1722.0,"this thing that's always in the distance, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1719,1724.0,that you can never reach.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1721,1725.0,"No matter how quickly you travel,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1722,1728.0,"you'll never be able to get to that thing, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1725,1733.0,We know that black holes eat things and grow.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1730,1734.0,"So for example, that big,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1731,1737.0,that artist rendition I showed with the swirling black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1734,1738.0,"sucking in the blue giant,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1735,1741.0,that black holes or event horizon grows
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1738,1742.0,the more stuff that it sucks in.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1739,1745.0,So we know that that event horizon is growing.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1742,1747.0,"If you are on the inside, this thing would be growing too."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1744,1748.0,"So this horizon,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1745,1751.0,think about what it means to be inside of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1748,1752.0,"You'd have this point of space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1749,1755.0,"this region of space that you could never get to,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1752,1760.0,"and it's always receding from you, a horizon, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1757,1764.0,"So, so yeah, just to, you know, show,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1761,1766.0,so you have stuff that's falling
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1763,1769.0,"into the black hole, the event horizon grows, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1766,1772.0,But think about what it then means for you
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1769,1774.0,right now on earth.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1771,1779.0,Think about your situation right now here on earth.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1776,1782.0,"If you look out into space, there is a horizon very,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1779,1787.0,"very far out, away, beyond which we cannot see,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1784,1789.0,"but we know there's stuff there,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1786,1790.0,but we can never possibly see.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1787,1792.0,"And no matter how quickly you travel,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1789,1794.0,you'd never be able to get to it.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1791,1798.0,That's remarkably similar to what you would experience
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1795,1802.0,on the inside of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1799,1804.0,"And it turns out that the mathematics, and again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1801,1806.0,"you should always look closely at the mathematics,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1803,1809.0,it turns out that the mathematics of the interior
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1806,1811.0,of a black hole is almost identical
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1808,1814.0,to the mathematics of the exterior of the black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1811,1815.0,You have to do some stuff with the infinity
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1812,1818.0,"is going to infinity versus zero, but yeah, trust me,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1815,1819.0,"you don't have to trust me,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1816,1821.0,you can look it up in your textbook on gravity that you have
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1818,1822.0,"on your bedside table, but this is, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1819,1824.0,this is actually what is going on.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1821,1827.0,"Mathematically, it makes sense as well."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1824,1831.0,"So there's also another reason to think that this is, oh,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1828,1834.0,"so yeah, and for example, I wanted to show off"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1831,1836.0,"my nice animation here, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1833,1840.0,"So as stuff, come on, show me here, there we go, yeah, okay."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1837,1841.0,"It's the same thing, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1838,1842.0,"You have things that are coming,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1839,1846.0,so this edge of the observable universe
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1843,1847.0,"is getting bigger and bigger, and for example,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1844,1848.0,"if you were able to live for,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1845,1850.0,"you know, hundreds of millions of years,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1847,1853.0,there would be stuff that would be coming into your view
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1850,1854.0,that you couldn't see before.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1851,1856.0,So this is very similar to what you would experience
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1853,1859.0,inside a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1856,1862.0,"So the other thing that's interesting about this, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1859,1865.0,is that we know that the universe is expanding
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1862,1867.0,"and then if you run the clock backwards,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1864,1869.0,"like the YouTube slider of the universe,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1866,1871.0,"you just run it backwards, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1868,1873.0,"eventually that means that everything far, far back"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1870,1876.0,"in time, if everything's expanding now,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1873,1877.0,everything had to be packed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1874,1880.0,into a tiny dense little point at some point.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1877,1883.0,And that's kind of similar to what you would expect
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1880,1888.0,from a singularity in the middle of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1885,1892.0,"So does this mean that our universe,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1889,1895.0,"which was born from a black hole, 13.8,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1892,1898.0,"or was born from a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1895,1900.0,was our universe actually birthed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1897,1906.0,from a black hole in another universe?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1903,1908.0,And does that mean that black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1905,1913.0,in our universe are doing the same thing?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1910,1919.0,Every black hole could be a seed to a new universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1916,1921.0,"And I see the looks on your faces as well,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1918,1922.0,"and I completely agree with you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1919,1924.0,"because at the end of the day,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1921,1928.0,I am an experimentalist and these ideas are wonderful.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1925,1930.0,I love these fantastic ideas.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1927,1931.0,I love to read about them.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1928,1932.0,I love to have theorists go crazy and show me
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1929,1934.0,"their new papers, and look, this is happening."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1931,1939.0,"At the end of the day, I need to see some evidence."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1936,1941.0,And it currently turns out
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1938,1943.0,there is scant possibility for us to gather
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1940,1947.0,any evidence for this hypothesis in the foreseeable future.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1944,1950.0,"So at the end of the day, so again, this is not,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1947,1952.0,"this may sound very science fictiony, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1949,1954.0,"but it's actually, at the end of the day,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1951,1955.0,"you can find solutions, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1952,1957.0,"going back and looking closely at the math,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1954,1959.0,you can find solutions that show that inside
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1956,1961.0,"of a black hole, it doesn't have have to be"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1958,1962.0,"just this singularity point, right, that, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1959,1964.0,that makes no sense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1961,1965.0,It's like this mathematical nonsense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1962,1966.0,"In fact, as you've heard,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1963,1969.0,"and again, I mentioned Christopher Nolan movies, right,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1966,1970.0,"in fact, there are solutions"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1967,1973.0,"that if you go into a black hole, it's not just a point,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1970,1974.0,but it could be a so-called wormhole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1971,1976.0,or an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1973,1978.0,"And in principle, this wormhole"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1975,1980.0,"could be a wormhole from here,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1977,1982.0,from our universe to some other point
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1979,1985.0,in our own spacetime within our own universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1982,1988.0,"Or it could be to another universe within a multiverse,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1985,1992.0,or it in fact could be a little seed to another universe.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1989,1996.0,"But again, I'm an experimentalist,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1993,1999.0,how are we going to test this?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1996,2001.0,Here's the problem.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,1998,2005.0,Can we test the universe-in-a-black-hole idea?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2002,2007.0,"First of all,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2004,2011.0,the way you test it is to go into a black hole and find out.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2008,2013.0,"As we mentioned, that's a one-way trip."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2010,2015.0,"I really, really thank you for doing that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2012,2017.0,but I'm never gonna be able to learn what you learned.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2014,2020.0,"So that's, you know, that's a one-way trip."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2017,2022.0,"Second, there's no distinguish,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2019,2024.0,there's no experiment I can come up with currently
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2021,2026.0,that would enable me to distinguish
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2023,2029.0,"that hypothesis from some other hypothesis, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2026,2031.0,"So if I say, oh yeah, well, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2028,2033.0,"we live in an enormous black hole, okay, that's, okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2030,2035.0,"you know, part of the equations"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2032,2036.0,show me that that's indistinguishable
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2033,2038.0,from our current experience.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2035,2040.0,But how am I gonna distinguish this
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2037,2042.0,from some other hypothesis?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2039,2044.0,"There are possibly some ideas floating around,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2041,2046.0,but they're not so good.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2043,2048.0,"Third, what does it mean for me"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2045,2051.0,to contact another universe?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2048,2054.0,I would love for someone to give me a coherent answer
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2051,2056.0,"to this question, because the ideas"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2053,2057.0,that come up make no sense.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2054,2059.0,"For example, what if I have a measuring device here"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2056,2061.0,"in my universe that works really, really well,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2058,2062.0,"like a ruler or you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2059,2064.0,"some kind of extra device or something,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2061,2066.0,and I take it into another universe
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2063,2070.0,where carbon atoms don't exist.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2067,2072.0,The measuring device is useless.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2069,2075.0,So this is just one extreme example.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2072,2077.0,"But at the current, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2074,2079.0,"currently, there's not a way for us"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2076,2081.0,to even test this hypothesis.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2078,2082.0,"So I love these ideas, I love them,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2079,2084.0,"I want more ideas like this,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2081,2087.0,but I also want ways to be able to test them.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2084,2089.0,"However, I am actually excited for the future"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2086,2090.0,"because I know from history,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2087,2094.0,I would never want to underestimate humanity's ability
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2091,2096.0,"to come up with ways, ingenious ways"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2093,2098.0,"to test impossible ideas, so, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2095,2100.0,I'm hoping somebody in this room will actually end up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2097,2101.0,studying physics and find the way
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2098,2104.0,that we can test this hypothesis.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2101,2107.0,"So again, at the end of the day, we, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2104,2109.0,"we don't have a way to currently test this,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2106,2112.0,but one thing we haven't covered at all so far
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2109,2115.0,"is how black holes come into existence,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2112,2117.0,"because if we knew that, in principle,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2114,2120.0,"we could design an experiment to make some, or maybe to,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2117,2122.0,"you know, to figure out how we could study this"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2119,2123.0,"in a sort of indirect way,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2120,2125.0,"we don't have to directly go into a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2122,2127.0,"just like we don't have to directly, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2124,2129.0,"the Higgs boson, we discovered it, the LHC."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2126,2131.0,"You'll never hold the Higgs boson in your hand,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2128,2134.0,but we can indirectly see that the Higgs boson
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2131,2136.0,"exists based upon its decay properties, things like that."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2133,2139.0,So maybe there's an indirect way to understand
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2136,2140.0,"whether or not we live inside of a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2137,2143.0,but first we need to figure out how to make black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2140,2146.0,"Okay, so how does the universe make black holes?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2143,2149.0,"How does the universe make these twisted vortices,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2146,2150.0,these things that are so dense
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2147,2153.0,that they nearly puncture the fabric of spacetime?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2150,2157.0,"Well, one way is when an enormous star dies."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2154,2159.0,"After billions of years, a star can exhaust"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2156,2161.0,the fuel it needs to burn.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2158,2164.0,"And with a final hurrah, it explodes,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2161,2167.0,"and then with no more nuclear fusion to push it outward,,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2164,2171.0,gravity wins and the whole thing collapses in on itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2168,2174.0,And this collapse can be so severe
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2171,2177.0,that it creates a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2174,2180.0,"So, you know, so what you can see"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2177,2181.0,"from this is that you need, and also,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2178,2184.0,so let me mention the apple-sized black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2181,2186.0,So the gentleman's black hole right here that he's holding.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2183,2188.0,So these apple-sized black holes could in principle
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2185,2191.0,be something called primordial black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2188,2192.0,That means that these could be black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2189,2195.0,"that were caused right back near the moment to the Big Bang,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2192,2197.0,right when the universe was born.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2194,2199.0,And the particular way that the universe expanded
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2196,2202.0,could have popped a bunch of these primordial black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2199,2204.0,into existence and they just sprinkled
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2201,2206.0,"around the universe for billions of years, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2203,2210.0,So you can see that you need an extremely violent event
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2207,2211.0,to make a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2208,2212.0,It's why you can't make a black hole out of you
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2209,2214.0,"or an apple or anything, or the earth."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2211,2218.0,So is it possible that we could make black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2215,2223.0,where I work at the Large Hadron Collider?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2220,2226.0,So the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 kilometer
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2223,2228.0,circular tunnel on the border of France
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2225,2230.0,"and Switzerland, about a hundred meters underground."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2227,2233.0,"And in this tunnel, we use superconducting magnets colder"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2230,2236.0,than outer space to accelerate protons
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2233,2237.0,to almost the speed of light.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2234,2239.0,And then we slam them into each other millions
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2236,2242.0,of times a second.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2239,2246.0,"On the particle level, this is a pretty violent event."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2243,2249.0,"And in fact, it's theoretically possible that we could make tiny,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2246,2252.0,minuscule versions of black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2249,2254.0,that would evaporate immediately.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2251,2255.0,"But I know of what some of you might be thinking,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2252,2258.0,and I see some of the looks on your faces as well.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2255,2259.0,"Let me make very clear to you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2256,2262.0,there's no way we're ever gonna make a regular black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2259,2265.0,at the large Hadron Collider for the following reason.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2262,2267.0,"You should actually know this by now,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2264,2268.0,"since you've seen the first, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2265,2271.0,"the first half of this talk, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2268,2274.0,"Black holes are all about gravity, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2271,2277.0,"And so, we're colliding protons together"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2274,2280.0,"at the Large Hadron Collider, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2277,2282.0,Protons get close to each other and they start to experience
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2279,2284.0,"interactions, forces, and we only know"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2281,2287.0,"of four known forces, fundamental forces in nature, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2284,2289.0,"We have three that, you know, the strong force,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2286,2290.0,"the weak force, the electromagnetism,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2287,2292.0,"and then gravity, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2289,2293.0,"But they're not all the same strength,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2290,2295.0,especially at the particle level.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2292,2296.0,"When two particles get close together,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2293,2299.0,some are more powerful than others.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2296,2301.0,"So when two protons get close together,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2298,2303.0,the strongest force we know of is called the strong force.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2300,2306.0,"It's a very nice name for it, so let's give that"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2303,2308.0,a strength of one.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2305,2310.0,"Compared to the strong force,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2307,2314.0,the force of gravity is 10 to the power minus 39.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2311,2316.0,"There's no possible way that, in fact,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2313,2319.0,we completely neglect this when we do calculations
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2316,2322.0,"at the Large Hadron Collider of proton collisions,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2319,2324.0,the force of gravity between two protons is completely
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2321,2327.0,negligible compared to the others.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2324,2330.0,So there's no possible way we're gonna make a black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2327,2333.0,out of two protons at the Large Hadron Collider.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2330,2334.0,"Oh, and then I wanted to show you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2331,2335.0,show off my nice animation here.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2332,2337.0,"Pow, black hole, no."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2334,2339.0,(audience laugh)
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2336,2342.0,Just to hammer it home.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2339,2349.0,"But recall that the reason why, well,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2346,2350.0,I'll put it this way.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2347,2352.0,The reason why we physicists are obsessed with
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2349,2356.0,and fascinated by black holes is because they could help us
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2353,2357.0,"answer one of the biggest open questions,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2354,2360.0,long-standing questions in physics.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2357,2362.0,And this is the question as to whether gravity
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2359,2366.0,and quantum mechanics have anything to do with each other.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2363,2369.0,"In physics, we have two fantastically good"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2366,2371.0,theoretical models that have withstood essentially
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2368,2373.0,all of our experimental tests.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2370,2374.0,"The first is called general relativity,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2371,2377.0,"which we talked about, which governs"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2374,2379.0,how gravity works on very large scales.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2376,2381.0,"And the other is called quantum field theory,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2378,2382.0,"quantum mechanics,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2379,2384.0,which governs the world of the very small.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2381,2387.0,Each of these by itself ranks among the most impressive
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2384,2390.0,intellectual achievement of humankind.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2387,2392.0,But there's a problem.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2389,2395.0,"When we try to naively combine these two theories,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2392,2396.0,hoping for a more fundamental theory
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2393,2399.0,"of the universe, everything breaks."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2396,2402.0,We get nonsense answers like infinite energies
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2399,2404.0,or probabilities greater than one.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2401,2405.0,(imitates explosion)
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2402,2407.0,"When this happens, like I said,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2404,2411.0,this is the universe's way of telling us to think harder.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2408,2414.0,And it's entirely possible that the reason
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2411,2416.0,that we don't fully understand how gravity
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2413,2418.0,"and quantum mechanics work together,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2415,2420.0,is that in fact there's something we're missing
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2417,2423.0,about the fabric of space itself.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2420,2426.0,"So one of the ways that gravity could,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2423,2429.0,"because basically the question is, why is gravity so weak"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2426,2430.0,compared to the other forces?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2427,2432.0,Why is that?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2429,2435.0,"If you were some kind of, you know,,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2432,2437.0,"logical universe-making person,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2434,2438.0,you would never make it that way.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2435,2440.0,It makes no sense that you'd have one force
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2437,2441.0,that's all the way down here
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2438,2444.0,"and all these other forces that are up here, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2441,2447.0,So one of the ways that this could happen is if in fact
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2444,2450.0,our understanding of the fabric of space
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2447,2452.0,needs to be changed.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2449,2454.0,"In fact, one of the ways that we could be missing"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2451,2456.0,the fact that gravity is so weak compared
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2453,2459.0,to the other forces is if gravity in fact exists
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2456,2461.0,in extra dimensions of space
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2458,2465.0,that are tiny and curled up at every single point in space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2462,2468.0,"And so gravity in fact, leaks into these other dimensions."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2465,2471.0,And if we had some magical measuring device that would allow
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2468,2474.0,"us to somehow measure gravity in these other dimensions,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2471,2477.0,we would measure it as being just as strong
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2474,2479.0,as the other forces.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2476,2481.0,"This would be amazing, and, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2478,2483.0,"to give a few more details,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2480,2486.0,"so basically what it means is that the Planck scale,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2483,2487.0,"so I mentioned this thing called the, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2484,2490.0,"the Planck energy or the, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2487,2492.0,the Planck length and things like this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2489,2496.0,Basically this is a length and energy and a time scale
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2493,2499.0,that is sort of a limitation based upon the constants
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2496,2502.0,"of nature, and what it means is that the radius"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2499,2505.0,"of a sphere, for example, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2502,2507.0,remember that it takes a certain amount of stuff
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2504,2509.0,you have to pack into a certain volume
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2506,2511.0,"to make a black hole, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2508,2513.0,"But that radius, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2510,2514.0,"that Schwarzschild radius,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2511,2516.0,"the radius part in the equation that I was showing you,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2513,2519.0,"right, that radius, the definition of a radius"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2516,2522.0,changes when you have extra dimensions of space.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2519,2524.0,"And in fact, what it can do is it can make"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2521,2526.0,"this Planck level, this Planck scale"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2523,2529.0,which is the place at which gravity and quantum mechanics
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2526,2530.0,"have something to do with each other,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2527,2532.0,"it could actually bring it down,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2529,2534.0,"it actually lowers what this Planck scale is,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2531,2536.0,"and it makes it so in principle,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2533,2539.0,you could make a black hole out of two small things
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2536,2542.0,"with very, very small amount of, with a much smaller energy."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2539,2545.0,"So this is entirely possible,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2542,2547.0,but what it means is that we're not gonna make a regular
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2544,2549.0,black hole at the Large Hadron Collider.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2546,2552.0,"In principle, we can make a tiny minuscule object"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2549,2554.0,that would snap and pop into existence
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2551,2555.0,and snap into the extra dimensions
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2552,2558.0,and wobble around a bit before then decaying
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2555,2559.0,and they're evaporating into things
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2556,2560.0,that hit our detector.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2557,2563.0,"And it, you know, so this is a not an artist rendition,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2560,2565.0,but this is a simulated version of if we were to make
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2562,2567.0,"a miniature black hole at the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2564,2569.0,it might look something like this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2566,2571.0,"So again, this is,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2568,2573.0,you might be a little bit weirded out by this
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2570,2575.0,"that we might be making miniature black holes,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2572,2576.0,"but just to, you know,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2573,2577.0,"I don't want to go, I'm getting a little bit late here,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2574,2581.0,"but you know, just wanted to show that in fact this is"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2578,2582.0,"nothing to worry about, because even again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2579,2585.0,if even if we make a miniature black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2582,2586.0,"at the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2583,2587.0,"it would evaporate immediately,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2584,2588.0,one of these miniature things.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2585,2590.0,And it would be fantastic if we did
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2587,2592.0,because it would help us understand
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2589,2594.0,how gravity and quantum mechanics work together and help us
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2591,2597.0,maybe answer one of these biggest open questions in science.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2594,2599.0,"But if you're still worried,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2596,2601.0,"don't worry at all because the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2598,2604.0,"we use very high energies at the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2601,2606.0,but we are no match for nature.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2603,2608.0,Nature has much higher energy collisions going on
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2605,2611.0,"all the time, just a few kilometers above your head."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2608,2614.0,So above your head right now are cosmic ray protons
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2611,2617.0,coming in from outer space all the time
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2614,2618.0,and they come into the upper atmosphere
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2615,2620.0,and they smack into the atoms that are up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2617,2622.0,in the upper atmosphere.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2619,2627.0,"And so, if these collisions are happening"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2624,2629.0,all the time at energies that are much higher
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2626,2631.0,"than the Large Hadron Collider, and you've never actually,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2628,2633.0,you never experienced a quantum black hole
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2630,2635.0,that suddenly comes into your body and decays
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2632,2636.0,and eats you up.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2633,2637.0,This has never happened.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2634,2639.0,"So if this has never happened in the upper atmosphere,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2636,2642.0,it's not going to happen to Large Hadron Collider.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2639,2643.0,"And I think for the sake of time,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2640,2645.0,"I'm gonna go through these, oh,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2642,2647.0,show off my nice animations.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2644,2649.0,So they can actually do different things.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2646,2651.0,"So if we saw these quantum black holes,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2648,2652.0,"these miniature black holes in the upper atmosphere,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2649,2655.0,"they would do certain things, blah, blah, blah."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2652,2656.0,They could in fact pass all the way through
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2653,2659.0,the earth and go through the other side.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2656,2661.0,"Or in fact, they could decay right near the surface"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2658,2663.0,of the earth and we might be able to detect these.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2660,2664.0,"So in fact, there are experiments, they're looking"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2661,2668.0,"for things like this, but okay,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2665,2670.0,even though we could potentially make miniature black holes
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2667,2672.0,"at the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2669,2675.0,we haven't seen any evidence of them yet.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2672,2676.0,"Oh, this is very sad."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2673,2683.0,But maybe we just need a bigger collider.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2680,2685.0,Discussions are currently underway for the potential
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2682,2687.0,"successor to the Large Hadron Collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2684,2689.0,"the future circular collider,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2686,2691.0,which would be a hundred kilometers around
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2688,2695.0,and could reach energy seven times that currently used.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2692,2698.0,But will that be big enough?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2695,2701.0,"Maybe quantum gravity, the holy grail,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2698,2703.0,"this thing we've been searching for,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2700,2709.0,maybe quantum gravity is waiting for us on the moon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2706,2712.0,"So last time I was here at your illustrious institution,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2709,2714.0,I gave an entire talk about the concept
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2711,2716.0,of a Big Bang machine on the moon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2713,2718.0,And I talked in very kind of rough details
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2715,2721.0,about what it would take to build a collider
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2718,2722.0,that goes around the moon and why
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2719,2723.0,we would wanna do this.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2720,2726.0,"And just a few months ago, in fact,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2723,2729.0,a colleague and I finally wrote a paper about this concept.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2726,2732.0,"And it turns out, so you might think it's like building a,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2729,2734.0,"you know, so a colossal collider"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2731,2736.0,"around the moon will be,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2733,2739.0,"where the Large Hadron Collider is 27 kilometers around,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2736,2742.0,"a circular collider on the moon will be 11,000 kilometers"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2739,2744.0,around and could reach energies
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2741,2747.0,a thousand times that currently used.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2744,2749.0,And I see the looks on some of your faces too.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2746,2752.0,So building a collider around the moon
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2749,2756.0,to potentially make miniature black holes on the moon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2753,2758.0,Is this crazy?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2755,2761.0,"And in fact, I went through the exercise"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2758,2764.0,with a colleague of mine and it turns out it's not crazy.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2761,2766.0,"In fact, there's no show stoppers to building"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2763,2770.0,a circular collider around the circumference of the moon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2767,2772.0,"All the technology is there, all of the sciences there."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2769,2774.0,It's just a matter of scale.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2771,2776.0,It's just a matter of development and scale.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2773,2780.0,A circular collider on the moon sometime in the 22nd century
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2777,2782.0,"is something that might sound impossible,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2779,2783.0,but it's just regular impossible.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2780,2785.0,"It's not impossible impossible,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2782,2787.0,"and regular impossible, we can do."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2784,2789.0,Regular impossible is only impossible right up
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2786,2792.0,until the moment somebody makes it possible.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2789,2795.0,So is that going to be big enough though?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2792,2798.0,Maybe a moon collider is not large enough for us to make
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2795,2799.0,these miniature black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2796,2801.0,"Again, the whole point here is that we wanted"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2798,2803.0,"to understand how, what, like what's actually going on"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2800,2804.0,inside of a black hole?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2801,2805.0,How do they get made?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2802,2807.0,Maybe we could find a way to make them
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2804,2810.0,in a laboratory so we could understand them.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2807,2811.0,"The place where we'd really, really,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2808,2814.0,really want to go to understand this completely
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2811,2815.0,"is called this Planck scale, right?"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2812,2817.0,"And the Planck energy, again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2814,2819.0,"if these extra dimensions don't exist,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2816,2822.0,then the Planck scale is something extremely high.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2819,2825.0,This is an energy at which gravity and quantum mechanics
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2822,2826.0,must have something to do with each other.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2823,2830.0,"Again, the larger collider you build, the bigger the energy,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2827,2832.0,the better chance you have to discover things
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2829,2834.0,like miniature black holes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2831,2838.0,"So, but the problem is to make a Planck scale,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2835,2840.0,"Planck scale collider, by some estimates,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2837,2843.0,you'd have to build a collider that circles around
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2840,2847.0,the outer edge of the solar system.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2844,2850.0,Clearly we're going to need some major innovation
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2847,2852.0,to do that.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2849,2854.0,"And by the time our society,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2851,2857.0,our civilization advances far enough to be able
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2854,2860.0,"to build a super structure like that,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2857,2864.0,we'll probably also have mastered interstellar space travel.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2861,2867.0,"And at that point, 500 years from now,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2864,2870.0,you will be sitting in your ship zipping through the void
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2867,2876.0,of empty space to explore a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2873,2881.0,"One day, in your ship, you get tired,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2878,2884.0,you notice that you should arrive at your destination
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2881,2886.0,"in about 20,000 years."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2883,2890.0,"So you decide to take a 20,000 year-long nap."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2887,2892.0,"And as you lie down on your cryogenic bed,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2889,2896.0,you very slightly bump your ship's accelerator.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2893,2898.0,You don't even notice.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2895,2902.0,"After 20,000 years you awake, fix yourself a cup of coffee,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2899,2905.0,and you notice from your gravitational sensor
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2902,2909.0,that something is very wrong.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2906,2914.0,You appear to be too close to the event horizon
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2911,2917.0,of your black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2914,2923.0,You look out the window and you see an enormous profoundly
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2920,2927.0,"black disc in space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2924,2929.0,the light from the stars and galaxies behind it
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2926,2933.0,twisted and deformed.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2930,2936.0,"You stare into the center of this void,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2933,2938.0,a cosmic eye staring back at you.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2935,2944.0,And it's the emptiest thing you've ever seen.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2941,2946.0,"Your jaw drops and your eyes widen,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2943,2950.0,and then you realize that you're not sure if you've passed
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2947,2953.0,"the event horizon yet, the point of no return."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2950,2955.0,You double check your gravitational sensor
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2952,2958.0,and it says you're not there yet.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2955,2962.0,You have five seconds to blast away.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2959,2963.0,"You jump from your chair,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2960,2964.0,"leaping toward the controls for the rocket,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2961,2966.0,"spilling your hot coffee on your hands,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2963,2967.0,burning your fingers.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2964,2969.0,You scream and fall to the ground.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2966,2975.0,"And by the time you get up, it's too late."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2972,2982.0,You're passing the event horizon of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2979,2989.0,"You nearly stop breathing, your mouth feels like sand,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2986,2993.0,and you close your eyes.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2990,3000.0,You can't believe that this could possibly be happening.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2997,3002.0,"You open your eyes and look out the window again,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,2999,3007.0,and everything looks about the same.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3004,3009.0,"The disc is getting a little larger,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3006,3012.0,"but otherwise, everything is the same."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3009,3014.0,"You feel the same, nothing is different."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3011,3015.0,"You think maybe your estimate was wrong,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3012,3017.0,maybe there's still time to escape.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3014,3019.0,You triple check your gravitational sensor
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3016,3024.0,"and no matter which direction you pointed,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3021,3032.0,it says you are pointing toward the center of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3029,3040.0,And then you know for sure you've passed the event horizon.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3037,3049.0,"You are inside a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3046,3054.0,a calm terror settles over you.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3051,3058.0,How did you get in this situation?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3055,3062.0,"Very slowly, while you were asleep,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3059,3066.0,the conditions of the universe around you were changing
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3063,3074.0,"nearly imperceptibly, and then suddenly it was too late."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3071,3078.0,"Floating in your ship inside of a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3075,3081.0,what do you do?
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3078,3085.0,"You might start thinking of possible escapes, I mean,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3082,3087.0,you know logically it's impossible to go back
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3084,3088.0,"outside of a black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3085,3090.0,but you think maybe there's something you missed.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3087,3091.0,You go through all the options.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3088,3093.0,"I mean, maybe all the clever scientists"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3090,3095.0,were wrong and there's some way to escape that
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3092,3096.0,hadn't been anticipated.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3093,3098.0,You start fantasizing that maybe if you just wait
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3095,3100.0,"long enough or you just get lucky,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3097,3103.0,you will eventually pass back over the event horizon
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3100,3104.0,"and could zoom away from the black hole,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3101,3106.0,"back to the way things were, back to the world"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3103,3109.0,"you once knew, and as you're fantasizing,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3106,3113.0,you look down and you see that your feet are drifting away
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3110,3119.0,"from you and your legs are being stretched into long,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3116,3124.0,thin spaghetti-like strands.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3121,3129.0,"And then suddenly, your shoes are so far away"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3126,3132.0,that you can't see them anymore.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3129,3137.0,"And in that split second, before you reach the center,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3134,3140.0,you realize two things.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3137,3144.0,"One, that no one really knows what happens"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3141,3147.0,in the center of a black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3144,3151.0,"And two, there is no going back."
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3148,3163.0,The only way out is directly through the black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3160,3169.0,Sometimes reality
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3166,3176.0,becomes twisted seemingly beyond recognition.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3173,3178.0,"And right now,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3175,3185.0,"as the oceans burn and the global temperature rises,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3182,3188.0,"and as literal fascists have returned to our politics,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3185,3195.0,"and as so many of us are dead from a mismanaged pandemic,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3192,3198.0,you would be forgiven for thinking that we had fallen
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3195,3203.0,into a societal black hole.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3200,3207.0,"In retrospect, it happened so slowly,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3204,3213.0,almost imperceptibly while so many of us were asleep.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3210,3218.0,And then everything changed.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3215,3223.0,"But just like in a black hole in space,"
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3220,3228.0,the only way out is through.
A8bBhkhZtd8,The other end of a black hole – with James Beacham,3225,3230.0,Our current societal black hole
