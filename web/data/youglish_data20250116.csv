j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,589,599.0,"With Newton's principles it became, in theory, possible to accurately predict the results"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,596,602.0,that would be caused by almost any action.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,599,608.0,"In 1814, French scholar Pierre-Simon Laplace - the first person to publish literature about"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,605,613.0,causal determinism - took this to the next level with a thought experiment that became
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,610,616.0,known as Laplace's Demon.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,613,623.0,"Since classical physics explained every reaction in existence, Laplace reasoned we could theoretically"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,620,629.0,understand the causes and effects that had led us to any point in time.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,626,633.0,We could also predict the future from that point in time onwards.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,630,641.0,"So, if there were some intelligence, let's call it a demon or a god or giant turnip named"

j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,651,660.0,happened in the past and predict everything that would happen in the future.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,657,667.0,And there's not a lot of space for free will when every action is predictable and
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,664,669.0,already set in motion.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,666,675.0,The viability of Laplace's Turnip has since been undermined by the discovery of thermodynamic
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,672,681.0,"irreversibility, among other things, but the idea we're ruled by cause and effect - and"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,678,686.0,by extension the implication we might not be as responsible for our own actions as we
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,683,690.0,think we are - hasn't gone away.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,687,696.0,"And in 1983, American Physiologist Benjamin Libet conducted an experiment that rocked"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,693,703.0,the scientific world by providing compelling evidence that we don't have free will.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,700,710.0,Libet was monitoring brain activity in individuals carrying out a very simple action - tapping
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,707,712.0,their finger on a table.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,709,718.0,"His aim was to study how signals in our brain turn into physical actions in the real world,"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,715,726.0,but during the experiment he noticed something strange: he was measuring brain activity before
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,723,733.0,his test subjects reported having consciously decided to act - in other words their brains
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,730,738.0,were initiating finger movement before the subject had consciously made the decision
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,735,740.0,to move.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,737,746.0,"As far as Libet was concerned, this was neurological proof we are not the masters of our actions"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,743,752.0,- our brains are making decisions before we're aware of them and somehow covering up the
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,749,754.0,evidence.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,751,759.0,"We think we're acting autonomously, but it's a trick of the mind."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,756,762.0,It was a bad day for free will.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,759,768.0,"The results of Libet's work became well-known, for many ending the free will debate forever."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,765,774.0,But more recent research suggests the experiment may have been flawed in the first place - that
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,771,778.0,the brain activity Libet was interpreting as the initiator of finger movement in his
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,775,785.0,subjects might have been little more than background brain activity muddying his results.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,782,793.0,"In 2012, neuroscientist Aaron Schurger reran Libet's experiments with a few tweaks accounting"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,790,799.0,for this possibility and found that our brains might not be making sneaky decisions without
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,796,804.0,us knowing about them after all.The game was back on for free will.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,801,810.0,"Schurger's research has definitely not proved free will is a real thing, but it has forced"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,807,816.0,"a rethink of determinism, well of the hard variety at least."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,813,821.0,Hard determinism is the type we've been talking about until now - the belief that
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,818,827.0,free will and a deterministic universe are incompatible - it's one or the other.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,824,834.0,"But soft determinism, usually referred to as compatibilism, is the view that free will"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,831,836.0,and determinism can co-exist.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,833,843.0,"For compatibilists, this allows us to avoid simplifying the full complexity of human experience"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,840,848.0,"down to a series of physical laws, a process known as reductionism."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,845,853.0,It also opens up space for the uncertainty kicked up by quantum physics.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,850,858.0,"Hard determinism has its roots in the laws of classical physics, but these rules don't"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,855,863.0,"apply at a quantum level, a rather inconvenient issue that happens to be one of the biggest"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,860,866.0,unsolved problems in physics.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,863,870.0,"Scientists have yet to find a Theory of Everything to explain the way the whole universe works,"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,867,876.0,"from the super big to the sub-atomic, and until then they have to accept that the quantum"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,873,881.0,world and the macro world mostly operate according to different laws.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,878,886.0,"With this in mind, the closest thing we can find to causal determinism at the quantum"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,883,890.0,level are determined probabilities.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,887,895.0,"For example, it may not be possible to predict the trajectory of a sub-atomic particle in"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,892,902.0,"the same way you can accurately predict the trajectory of a planet or a frisbee, but particles"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,899,907.0,all obey determined probabilities that give them a degree of predictability.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,904,914.0,"Some people, including Einstein, argue there are hidden variables we simply can't see"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,911,919.0,"that would account for gaps in our ability to predict quantum behaviour, and if we knew"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,916,929.0,"these the universe would be fully deterministic, but this is hotly debated by other physicists."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,926,934.0,"Regardless of which side you take, quantum physics currently casts reasonable doubt on"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,931,940.0,"the idea of determinism - basically if the world around us is inherently unpredictable,"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,937,942.0,true determinism can't exist.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,939,948.0,"Of course, the big question is not 'Do you have free will?'but rather 'Why should"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,945,949.0,you care?'
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,946,954.0,"Sure, most of us like to think we have free will because we prefer to feel like we make"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,951,961.0,"our own choices, but if we are actually just highly sophisticated robots acting out the"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,958,967.0,"inevitable drama of a deterministic universe, what difference does that really make?"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,964,973.0,We still feel like we make our own decisions so everything ends up the same.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,970,979.0,"Well, for one thing it could alter how forgiving we are of each other's behaviour."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,976,986.0,"Take for example the case of Charles Whitman, a US marine known as the infamous Texas Tower"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,983,987.0,Sniper.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,984,992.0,"On the 1st of August 1966, Whitman killed his mother and wife, before heading to the"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,989,1000.0,"University of Texas, where he proceeded to kill another 14 people and wound 31 before"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,997,1002.0,police shot him dead.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,999,1008.0,"It remains one of the most horrific shootings in American history, but a recent study questions"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1005,1012.0,whether Whitman was truly responsible for his actions.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1009,1017.0,Doctors performing the autopsy on Whitman's body found a brain tumour pressing against
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1014,1023.0,"his amygdala, a part of the brain critical to emotional regulation and behavioural control."
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1020,1028.0,Whitman was one of 17 cases involved in a study that looked at examples of criminal
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1025,1032.0,behaviour committed by people with brain lesions.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1029,1036.0,"Even though the research subjects had brain lesions in different parts of their brains,"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1033,1043.0,the lesions were all found in places connected to a neurological system dubbed the 'criminality-associated
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1040,1044.0,network.'
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1041,1048.0,This network is closely linked with brain structures related to moral judgement and
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1045,1054.0,"decision-making, and researchers believe disruptions to these brain systems could have been responsible"
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1051,1058.0,for the individuals'criminal behaviour.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1055,1063.0,This conclusion raises some difficult questions about free will and how responsible any of
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1060,1065.0,us are for decisions.
j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1062,1071.0,"If our actions can be influenced so significantly by events in our brains, how much choice do"

j7AzDpkq8m8,Does Free Will Actually Exist?,1070,1078.0,Where do we draw the line of moral and legal responsibility?

_8vLkIj_Lsk,"How to know if it’s time to change careers | The Way We Work, a TED series",88,93.0,Number two: career changes are often gut-driven.

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,800,805.0,So I tell my father I love him all the time

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,803,807.0,He does the same.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,804,810.0,And it's unfortunate that it will take something
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,807,812.0,like that sometimes to do that.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,809,817.0,But I think it's been a huge lesson for each of us.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,814,820.0,And I'm so grateful that I could learn that lesson
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,817,823.0,without having to lose him and transfer that
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,820,825.0,into all the other relationships I have in my life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,822,829.0,Because we have examples every day of how precious life is.

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,828,834.0,And especially in the context of this past year
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,831,837.0,and all that has transpired with regard to unarmed black men
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,834,841.0,and women being killed by police and vigilante
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,838,844.0,"in a way that is not necessarily new,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,841,847.0,it is only new in the context of that we
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,844,849.0,live in a hyper-documented era in which everyone
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,846,850.0,has camera phones.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,847,853.0,And these are things that black people have been saying have
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,850,854.0,been happening for a long time.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,851,858.0,"But now, everybody has an iPhone or an Android,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,855,860.0,and it's brought to the forefront of our attention
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,857,862.0,in a way that it hasn't before.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,859,865.0,So my parents were accutely aware of this going up.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,862,868.0,"And I think for them, it was always"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,865,871.0,a wrestling of how do you reconcile
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,868,875.0,the tension between wanting your child to be a child
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,872,880.0,"and to run around and play and be curious and make mistakes,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,877,883.0,also knowing that the way I had to navigate the world
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,880,887.0,"was drastically different than my white friends,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,884,889.0,and that we couldn't do the same things.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,886,891.0,We couldn't act the same because they had
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,888,892.0,very different implications.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,889,894.0,"And I've been thinking a lot about this year,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,891,896.0,the pedagogy of black parenting and what
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,893,899.0,it means to raise a child in a world that
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,896,901.0,is often taught to fear them.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,898,904.0,And so I had the privilege of speaking at TED
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,901,908.0,a few weeks ago.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,905,911.0,"TED's a crazy experience, because you"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,908,915.0,"have the virtual reality corner over there, the 3D printing"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,912,916.0,corner over there.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,913,918.0,Al Gore's hanging out at the salad bar.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,915,919.0,It's just crazy.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,916,922.0,Bill Gates is walking around in a bowling suit.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,919,925.0,It's wild.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,922,928.0,I was afforded the opportunity to present there.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,925,931.0,"And for me, I was like, well, if I'm going to go speak at TED,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,928,933.0,a place that very much represents
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,930,938.0,"a different stratosphere of wealth and power and influence,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,935,942.0,I want to bring a message that I'm not sure
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,939,944.0,would otherwise be there.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,941,951.0,And I don't want people to not know that this exists.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,948,954.0,I think that there are people who
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,951,959.0,decide to purposely not engage and to ignore things.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,956,963.0,But I wanted to bring at least a part of what this broader Black
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,960,965.0,Lives Matter movement is about to the forefront of people's
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,962,968.0,attention who might not be receiving
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,965,969.0,that message in other ways.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,966,972.0,And so I've presented it and was immensely thankful
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,969,974.0,for the opportunity.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,971,976.0,And it's out in the world now.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,973,981.0,And this is it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,978,984.0,One night when I was 12 years old on an overnight field trip

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,989,995.0,"We hid behind cars, running through the darkness that"

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,996,1001.0,across the pavement.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,998,1004.0,"But within 10 minutes, my father came outside,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1001,1006.0,"grabbed me by my forearm, and led me into our room"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1003,1009.0,with an unfamiliar grip.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1006,1011.0,"Before I could say anything, tell them"

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1011,1019.0,"he derided me for being so naive, looked me in the eye,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1016,1024.0,"fear consuming his face, and said, Son, I'm sorry,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1021,1027.0,but you can't act the same as your white friends.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1024,1029.0,You can't pretend to shoot guns.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1026,1031.0,You can't run around in the dark.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1028,1035.0,You can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth.

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1038,1045.0,that some man would mistake this water for a good reason
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1042,1047.0,to wash all of this away.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1044,1049.0,These are the sorts of messages I've been
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1046,1051.0,inundated with my entire life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1048,1053.0,Always keep your hands where they can see them.

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1058,1064.0,"so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1061,1066.0,"so that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1063,1068.0,"so that we could be kids, not casket or concrete."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1065,1070.0,And it's not because they thought it would make us better
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1067,1071.0,than anyone else.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1068,1075.0,It's simply because they wanted to keep us alive.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1072,1077.0,"All of my black friends were raised with the same message,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1074,1078.0,the talk.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1075,1079.0,Given to us when we became old enough
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1076,1082.0,to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1081,1086.0,synonymous with something to be feared.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1083,1090.0,But what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1087,1093.0,"cannot simply be a child, that the whims of adolescence are"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1090,1095.0,too dangerous for your breath?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1092,1097.0,"Then you cannot simply be curious,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1094,1099.0,"for you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1096,1102.0,that someone's implicit bias might be the reason you
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1099,1104.0,don't wake up in the morning.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1101,1106.0,"But this cannot be what defines us,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1103,1108.0,because we have parents who raised us to understand that
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1105,1111.0,our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1108,1114.0,but for flying kites and jumping rope and laughing until
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1111,1115.0,our stomachs burst.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1112,1118.0,We had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1115,1119.0,"and not just to signal surrender,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1116,1121.0,and that the only thing that we should give up
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1118,1123.0,is the idea that we aren't worthy of this world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1120,1125.0,"So when we say that black lives matter,"

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1593,1598.0,And so I'm always careful in making sure
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1595,1600.0,that we're using language that's asset based
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1597,1601.0,rather than deficit based.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1598,1606.0,"And that when we're talking about students, for example,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1603,1608.0,"when we say something is wrong with the school,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1605,1609.0,we're not actually saying the children
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1606,1612.0,"in the school or the teachers themselves,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1609,1617.0,because we can't look at any of these things in isolation.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1614,1619.0,We can't think about education without also thinking
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1616,1621.0,"about mass incarceration, without also thinking"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1618,1623.0,"about housing discrimination, but also thinking"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1620,1625.0,about immigration policy.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1622,1628.0,"All of these things are deeply, deeply connected."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1625,1631.0,And so this poem is a way to remind myself
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1628,1633.0,that the young people I work with
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1630,1636.0,are brilliant and amazing and wonderful.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1633,1638.0,And it's everything around them that we
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1635,1640.0,need to work in partnership with them
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1637,1647.0,to fix instead of this idea of fixing them.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1644,1650.0,"When the world thinks about my students,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1647,1652.0,"too often they see caricatures of pity,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1649,1656.0,metaphors of misery that can do nothing for themselves.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1653,1658.0,"But every day, I see resilience."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1655,1661.0,I see boys and girls turn into young men and women
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1658,1662.0,right in front of my face.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1659,1665.0,I see students who walk to school on street corners
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1662,1668.0,where policeman can make them feel more terror than talent.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1665,1670.0,But they still show up for tutoring at 6:30
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1667,1671.0,in the morning.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1668,1674.0,So often we focus so much on the quicksand
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1671,1677.0,that we fail to see what has refused to drown.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1674,1679.0,"So when you think about my kids, don't just"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1676,1681.0,think about what holds them down.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1678,1683.0,Think about how they overcome it every day.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1680,1686.0,"Think of Janya, who turns my classroom into a coliseum,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1683,1688.0,every word she speaks coded in creativity.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1685,1690.0,Her poetry would have brought Homer to his feet.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1687,1692.0,"Think of Anna, who became an honor roll"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1689,1695.0,student when the world wanted to free and reduced lunch
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1692,,define her.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1693,1697.0,She is more than a number.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1694,1699.0,"Think of Chris, who has been working"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1696,1701.0,every day since he was 13.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1698,1703.0,That money helps his mother keep the lights on
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1700,1705.0,so that their world isn't covered in darkness.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1702,1707.0,My students have turned my classroom
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1704,1710.0,into a symphony of second chances.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1707,1711.0,Every day we write to right the wrongs
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1708,1713.0,that have been done to communities
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1710,1714.0,that never had a choice.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1711,1717.0,"We read to learn how to tell our own stories,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1714,1719.0,because no one can define who we are if we are the ones holding
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1716,1720.0,the dictionary.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1717,1722.0,So don't tell my kids aren't brilliant.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1719,1725.0,Don't tell me that they aren't walking miracle.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1722,1728.0,My students have taught me how to relearn every part of me.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1725,1731.0,I carry their stories like a back pocket full a prayer.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1728,1734.0,And I leave my classroom a better person every day.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1731,1738.0,"So when we speak of them, let us speak of humanity."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1735,1739.0,Let us speak of perseverance.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1736,1741.0,Let us speak of how funny they are.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1738,1743.0,Let us speak of how courageous they are.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1740,1745.0,Let us not focus so much on the shadow
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1742,1747.0,that we fail to see what stands above it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1744,1750.0,Let us celebrate the best of our kids
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1747,1754.0,as we would want anybody to celebrate the best of us.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1751,1755.0,"Thank you, guys."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1752,1762.0,[APPLAUSE]
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1759,1764.0,DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Hi to everybody in the room.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1761,1766.0,"Hi, everybody who's joining via live stream."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1763,1767.0,"My name is Damien Hooper-Campbell,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1764,1772.0,"proud member of Google's Black Googler network,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1769,1774.0,and also a member of the diversity team here.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1771,1776.0,"I'm going to be quick, because I really"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1773,1778.0,want to hand the remote control back over to you
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1775,,all in the audience.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1778,1783.0,"But I want to ask you a couple quick questions,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1780,1784.0,and then we'll pass it over.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1781,1787.0,"So the first one is, when did this happen?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1784,1788.0,CLINT SMITH: Yeah.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1785,1790.0,DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: You're a very talented brother.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1787,1793.0,"But when did you just know, I got this talent."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1790,1795.0,Bring us back to that moment.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1792,1797.0,How did this all happen for you?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1794,1799.0,CLINT SMITH: I've always loved reading and writing.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1796,1802.0,I was a strange big-headed child.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1799,1806.0,"And so when I was in third grade,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1803,1807.0,we had our third grade yearbook.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1804,1809.0,"And everybody could say, what did you"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1806,1810.0,want to be when you grow up?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1807,1812.0,"And so, eight years old, most third graders say,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1809,1814.0,I want to be an astronaut or a fireman
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1811,1817.0,or a ballerina or a football star.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1814,1822.0,"And mine was like, I want to be a Newbery Award winning author."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1819,1824.0,I was so lame.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1821,1828.0,[LAUGHTER]
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1825,1830.0,Reading and writing were directly
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1827,1833.0,associated with this notion of discovery.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1830,1837.0,My parents had these encyclopedias
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1834,1838.0,that they kept in our house.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1835,1841.0,"And if I ever had a question, my mom would say, look it up."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1838,1845.0,So I was always just a deeply curious kid
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1842,1847.0,and learned that spending time with words
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1844,1852.0,was how I could figure out how I would navigate the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1849,1854.0,But I also played sports my whole life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1851,1857.0,And I ended up getting a soccer scholarship to college.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1854,1858.0,But I didn't play a lot college.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1855,1862.0,And so I kind of had this 19-year-old existential crisis
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1859,1865.0,where this thing that had largely
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1862,1867.0,been the way I was identified my entire life I
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1864,1869.0,wasn't good at anymore.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1866,1871.0,I was sitting on the bench.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1868,1873.0,I would later learn that I should
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1870,1875.0,"have known, because New Orleans isn't necessarily"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1872,1879.0,a hotbed of soccer talent to compare yourself to.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1876,1882.0,"But yeah, so then I had an internship in New York City."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1879,1885.0,"And I went to a place called the Nuyorican Poetry Cafe,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1882,1886.0,the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1883,1889.0,And it changed my life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1886,1892.0,I'd never experienced art in that way.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1889,1895.0,So Nuyorican Poetry Cafe is a small poetry spot
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1892,1896.0,on the Lower East Side.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1893,1897.0,"But it's like the mecca of spoken word,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1894,1900.0,well known throughout the country and the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1897,1902.0,And the first poem I ever heard was
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1899,1906.0,a woman who did a poem about having Cerebral Palsy.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1903,1908.0,Disability wasn't something that was ever
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1905,1910.0,at the forefront of my consciousness.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1907,1912.0,"But in three minutes, the way I thought"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1909,1915.0,about an entire demographic of people completely changed.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1912,1917.0,"And to me, that was remarkable, someone could get on stage"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1914,1918.0,and tell their story.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1915,1921.0,And I entered the room thinking about the world one way
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1918,1923.0,and leave that same room thinking about the world
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1920,1924.0,completely differently.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1921,1925.0,"And I was like, I don't know what this is,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1922,1929.0,but I'm going to do it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1926,1933.0,"I mean, I'm a pretty awkward dude."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1930,1936.0,I was never the kid who was excited to share in class.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1933,1939.0,I was a fairly quiet kid.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1936,1941.0,And so the idea of standing in front of a group of strangers
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1938,1948.0,and being vulnerable was unsettling.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1945,1950.0,But I knew the end product and what it could do
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1947,1953.0,and what art at its best could do in that form.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1950,1956.0,"And yeah, I was fortunate to go to Davidson College,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1953,1958.0,a small liberal arts college.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1955,1959.0,Steph Curry was my classmate.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1956,1960.0,Shout out to Steph.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1957,1964.0,I see you.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1961,1967.0,"And yeah, liberal arts colleges, it's"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1964,1970.0,all about the journey and not the destination.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1967,1972.0,"I came back, and I was like, guys,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1969,1973.0,I'm gonna be a spoken word poet.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1970,1977.0,"And they were like, OK, Clint."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1974,1979.0,You write your poems.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1976,1981.0,"But I just worked on it, and I decided"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1978,1983.0,it was something I really wanted to be great at.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1980,1985.0,I became an English major.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1982,1989.0,I just took every opportunity I could to go to Charlotte
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1986,1991.0,"and spend time in the open mic community,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1988,1993.0,and just decided this was something I
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1990,1995.0,wanted to be a part of my life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1992,1997.0,And I could have never anticipated
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1994,1999.0,"that it would become what it's become, but I'm very grateful."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1996,2000.0,DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Yeah.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,1997,2003.0,We are very grateful that you visited
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2000,2007.0,"the Nuyorican Cafe and the whole nine, because you are very good"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2004,,it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2008,2014.0,"CLINT SMITH: No Nia Long, though."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2011,2016.0,"DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: So you touched on it a little bit,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2013,2018.0,about impact and influence.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2015,2020.0,"At Google, shout out to Google a little bit."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2017,2022.0,"On the diversity team, we talk a lot"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2019,2024.0,about expanding the pool of technologists.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2021,2026.0,"We look in, we say, well, we only"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2023,2029.0,have 2% of our workforce in the United States
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2026,2031.0,"at Google is black, and 3% are Hispanic."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2028,2034.0,And then if you really start to distill that
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2031,2037.0,"by who are in tech roles and non-tech roles,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2034,2038.0,the number becomes even crazier.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2035,2041.0,"And we know technology's running everything right now,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2038,2043.0,and for the foreseeable future.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2040,2044.0,"You're on the ground though, brother."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2041,2047.0,You're there with students every single day.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2044,2049.0,So think about impact.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2046,2056.0,How does the tech world connect with the students who

lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2056,2062.0,and help them to get excited about this the same way
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2059,2065.0,"that you get them excited about spoken word, et cetera?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2062,2066.0,How do we impact?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2063,2067.0,How do we influence?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2064,2071.0,"CLINT SMITH: Yeah, no, that's a great question."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2068,2072.0,I think of myself.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2069,2074.0,"I've never been a tech person, but like I said,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2071,2076.0,I always loved writing.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2073,2079.0,"But growing up, I didn't see a lot of black male writers."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2076,2081.0,I didn't really know many.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2078,2084.0,I wasn't exposed to many growing up.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2081,2087.0,"And there was one main writer, Walter Dean Myers."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2084,2091.0,He wrote a lot of books with young black male protagonists.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2088,2093.0,"And if it wasn't for him, I don't"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2090,2097.0,know that I would have ever been able to envision myself
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2094,2098.0,as a writer.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2095,2100.0,And I've never had the pleasure of meeting him.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2097,2103.0,He passed away last year.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2100,2107.0,But I wish I could tell him how deeply he impacted my life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2104,2111.0,"And I think it's because I was able to see myself, someone who"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2108,2116.0,"looked like me, in a role that either implicitly or directly I"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2113,2118.0,was told wasn't for me.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2115,2122.0,"When I say I want to be a writer, it's, in some ways,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2119,2124.0,"almost the same as saying I want to be a basketball player,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2121,2128.0,"I want to be a football-- people are like, oh, well, OK."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2125,2131.0,That's not something that is seen
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2128,2133.0,as attainable in some sorts.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2130,2137.0,"But because I had an image of someone who was doing it,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2134,2141.0,"who was doing it well, and who I could see myself in,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2138,2145.0,"it was just hugely, hugely important"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2142,2147.0,in a way that I'm only really beginning to understand.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2144,2149.0,"And so I think, with regard to tech,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2146,2152.0,I imagine that it's the same.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2149,2156.0,I taught high school.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2153,2161.0,"Kids are deeply imaginative individuals,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2158,2164.0,but they're also human.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2161,2168.0,"And so if you don't see someone who looks like you,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2165,2170.0,"or if you don't see someone who looks like you,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2167,2173.0,or are not told ever that this is something you can or should
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2170,2176.0,"do, then you don't even know that that's"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2173,2177.0,something you should reach for.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2174,2182.0,If all you know of Google is a bunch
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2179,2184.0,"of people who don't have brown faces,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2181,2187.0,then you don't ever envision yourself working at Google.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2184,2191.0,"And so I think part of what-- and I imagine, hopefully"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2188,2193.0,"you all are doing something like this before-- but I mean,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2190,2197.0,just literally putting people who
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2194,2201.0,"look like so many of our kids in front of our kids and saying,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2198,2202.0,you can do this.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2199,,You can.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2201,2206.0,"And even if it's different lived experiences,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2203,2210.0,"because black people are a very heterogeneous community,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2207,2213.0,and we all come from various backgrounds and experiences.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2210,2215.0,"But just the simple act of being able to-- like,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2212,2218.0,"if you came into my classroom, and I looked at you,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2215,2220.0,"and I was like, OK."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2217,2221.0,I could work at Google.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2218,2222.0,"I might not tell you that, because I'm"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2219,2224.0,"a stubborn 14-year-old and I'm like, man, whatever."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2221,2227.0,I ain't got the time.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2224,2228.0,But that's what I would feel.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2225,2231.0,And so I think it's really just about showing young folks
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2228,2234.0,"that you belong here, and then making"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2231,2237.0,them feel like they belong here once they get here.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2234,,DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Cool.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2235,2239.0,"Last question, and then we'll turn it over"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2236,2241.0,to you all in the audience.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2238,2244.0,I spent some time watching your TED talks this weekend.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2241,2246.0,And I literally was ironing while I was watching one.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2243,2250.0,"And I put it on for three times because it was so powerful,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2247,2252.0,and I didn't want to miss anything.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2249,2255.0,"And we do good work here, at least I feel like we do."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2252,2256.0,And I felt inspired.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2253,2261.0,But I guess there was one part-- the one about silence--
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2258,2262.0,where you said you had talked about spending
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2259,2267.0,so much of your life telling people what they wanted to hear
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2264,2269.0,versus what they needed to hear.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2266,2271.0,"You look out into the audience, there"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2268,2274.0,"are brilliant minds here-- black minds, white minds,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2271,2277.0,"Hispanic minds, just everything."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2274,2279.0,You have a captive audience here.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2276,2283.0,"What do we actually need to hear, as members of Google?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2280,2288.0,And how we can create impact to address many of the problems
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2285,2289.0,that you talk about?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2286,2290.0,CLINT SMITH: Yeah.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2287,2294.0,"Well, I mean, the first is to recognize the immense leverage"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2291,2296.0,"that an organization like Google-- I mean,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2293,2298.0,Google is one of the most powerful organizations
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2295,2299.0,in the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2296,2302.0,"I was having a conversation with some folks earlier,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2299,2305.0,"and they said, as soon as you tell someone,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2302,2307.0,"I work at Google, then almost the way they interact"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2304,2309.0,with you completely changes.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2306,2312.0,And so there is power there.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2309,2315.0,And so I think it goes back to recognizing
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2312,2319.0,"there's a level of influence, both as an individual who"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2316,2324.0,represents this organization and the organization holistically.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2321,2327.0,"And touching back on what I said before, making sure we're"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2324,2329.0,having honest conversations.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2326,2333.0,I think it's so important for every single person
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2330,2340.0,to be an ambassador of racial justice.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2337,2343.0,"We all, once we leave here, once we leave Google, like"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2340,2349.0,"all exist and navigate and exist in these different communities,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2346,2352.0,"and some of which have these conversations a lot,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2349,2354.0,some of which never have these conversations.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2351,2357.0,And I think for so long I was always
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2354,2359.0,"scared of making people feel uncomfortable,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2356,2366.0,"or taught to tiptoe around, just to like not ruffle feathers."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2363,2370.0,"But I had to sit back and say, in doing so,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2367,2377.0,"am I only perpetuating the status quo that's unacceptable,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2374,2382.0,a status quo that is like very helpful to certain groups
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2379,2385.0,of people and very dangerous for others.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2382,2390.0,And how can I engage in this conversation in a way that's
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2387,2393.0,"not going to immediately put someone on the defensive,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2390,2396.0,but also leaves them unsettled?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2393,2398.0,Because these are unsettling issues.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2395,2403.0,I don't want somebody to sit there after my TED talk poem
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2400,2404.0,and just feel good.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2401,2406.0,You shouldn't feel good.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2403,2408.0,The stuff that's happening is not OK.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2405,2412.0,So I think we all have to get it out of our brains
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2409,2414.0,that this should be a comfortable or safe
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2411,,conversation.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2413,2418.0,and we want people to be comfortable.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2415,2421.0,But what do we really mean when we're saying comfort?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2418,2423.0,And who are we talking about being comfortable?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2420,2426.0,And who are we talking about not being comfortable?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2423,2429.0,"So yeah, I think stepping out of this idea"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2426,2432.0,"that these conversations shouldn't be unsettling,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2429,2433.0,because I think they should.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2430,2438.0,"But at the same time, having a level of empathy to say,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2435,2439.0,"let's meet somebody where they're at,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2436,2441.0,"because otherwise, we're not going"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2438,2443.0,to move this conversation forward at all.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2440,2445.0,And I think that conversation clearly
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2442,2446.0,should be happening internally.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2443,2454.0,"But also, this is a hugely diverse room."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2451,2458.0,Many of you might interact with people of different backgrounds
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2455,2460.0,in a way here at Google that you don't in your life
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2457,2463.0,"once you leave here, and with people who"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2460,2465.0,don't have the same opportunity to engage
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2462,2467.0,with people from such different backgrounds.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2464,2469.0,And I think that's a certain level of capital
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2466,2475.0,that you should bring to dispel caricatures and stereotypes
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2472,2478.0,and pathologies and ensure that you're speaking up in a way
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2475,2483.0,"that, if your coworker was standing right next to you"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2480,2489.0,"when somebody said something negative about their community,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2486,2491.0,that they would expect you to speak up for them in a way
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2488,2493.0,that you would want them to speak up for you.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2490,2494.0,DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Love it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2491,2496.0,Thank you for answering those questions.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2493,2498.0,Now I want to turn it over to the audience
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2495,2500.0,to see if anybody else has questions.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2497,2502.0,AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2499,2504.0,I really enjoyed your presentation.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2501,2507.0,"My question is, you talked about reactions,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2504,2509.0,people's reactions to what you do
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2506,2511.0,and the work that you bring about.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2508,2512.0,What have been your experiences?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2509,2514.0,"How do people react, especially when"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2511,2516.0,you're in audiences that maybe it's
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2513,2518.0,a little uncomfortable for them to hear this?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2515,2519.0,What have been those reactions from some
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2516,2521.0,of those kind of top-tier people?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2518,2524.0,CLINT SMITH: Yeah.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2521,2528.0,They certainly span the spectrum.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2525,2532.0,"But for example, at TED, after I did that poem,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2529,2536.0,"I had a lot of folks come up after me kind of in tears,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2533,2537.0,or really emotional.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2534,2539.0,"And they were like, I could never"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2536,2542.0,imagine having to have that conversation with my child.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2539,2544.0,I'm so sorry.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2541,2547.0,"And I don't want them to apologize to me necessarily,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2544,2552.0,but I think there is a real gap in terms
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2549,2555.0,of just an understanding of how certain people navigate
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2552,2557.0,the world as compared to your own life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2554,2561.0,"And for me, it was very much like, I'm not"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2558,2564.0,trying to get up here and accuse anyone of anything.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2561,2568.0,I don't think that's necessarily productive
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2565,2570.0,"as much as it's like, this is something"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2567,2571.0,that is real in my life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2568,2574.0,And I'm always ensuring that I'm speaking specifically
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2571,2577.0,"for my own life, because I can't speak for other people."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2574,2579.0,But I know that this is an experience that's
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2576,2582.0,"similar for a lot of people that I grew up with, a lot of people"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2579,2583.0,that I know.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2580,2587.0,And very much having it be something
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2584,2590.0,"that someone can't sweep aside, because this is real."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2587,2591.0,And it's personal.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2588,2596.0,And it's grounded in a very real lived experience that I had.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2593,2598.0,"And as an audience member, I want"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2595,2600.0,"you to understand that and grapple with it,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2597,2604.0,and think of how does that manifest itself in your life?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2601,2606.0,Have you seen something like this?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2603,2610.0,When you are with a colleague or a coworker or friend
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2607,2612.0,"of a different race, do you ever think"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2609,2615.0,about how they might have to interact with people
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2612,2619.0,and navigate the world in a different way than you do?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2616,2625.0,Are you cognizant of that in sort of everyday situations?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2622,2630.0,"And so really, just trying to plant this idea in their mind"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2627,2632.0,and ensure that it's not something
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2629,2636.0,that they can necessarily be naive of or ignore.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2633,2642.0,And so most people give me very positive reactions
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2639,2643.0,"and say, thank you so much."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2640,2646.0,I have no idea.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2643,2648.0,"The internet's full of trolls, right?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2645,2650.0,"So it will be like, Clint Smith hates white people."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2647,2652.0,"And it's like, all right, guys."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2649,,That's not true.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2651,2656.0,[LAUGHTER]
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2653,2660.0,Don't ever say that.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2657,2661.0,No.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2658,2665.0,But I'm thankful that people listen.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2662,2667.0,And the thing about art is that once you put it out
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2664,2669.0,"in the world, I have no control over how"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2666,2670.0,someone's going to hear it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2667,2672.0,"They're like, however many people in this room,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2669,2676.0,I'm sure that everybody got something different from some
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2673,2677.0,of the poems that I did.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2674,2679.0,And that kind of just comes with the territory.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2676,2682.0,But I just know that I want to put something out
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2679,2683.0,"into the world that's honest, and that's real,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2680,2686.0,and that will hopefully be thought-provoking
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2683,2687.0,in some regard.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2684,2690.0,"FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry, I'm taking a Ping question now"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2687,2691.0,from Erin Ross.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2688,2695.0,"She wants to know, ""What is your take on activism in 2015?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2692,2697.0,Is social media the answer?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2694,2698.0,"Or from your research and experience,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2695,2701.0,"do you believe it takes much more?"""
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2698,2704.0,"CLINT SMITH: I think what something like social media,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2701,2706.0,"like Twitter and Facebook, have done"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2703,2712.0,has really democratized this idea of what activism
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2709,2716.0,is and looks like and has decentralized who can engage
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2713,2717.0,and who can't engage in activism.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2714,2722.0,I think there's a lot of people kind of try to rag on hashtag
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2719,2725.0,"activism, so to speak, or online activism as this armchair"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2722,2727.0,activism where you don't necessarily
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2724,2730.0,have to invest anything personally into it.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2727,2731.0,You can just click or post.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2728,2735.0,But I would argue that everything
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2732,2739.0,that has transpired with regard to the Department of Justice
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2736,2742.0,"going down to Ferguson, with regard to the new police task"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2739,2745.0,force from the White House that just came out today
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2742,2748.0,that has dramatically demilitarized
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2745,2752.0,"the police from a federal level, all of these things,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2749,2754.0,"in many ways, manifested themselves"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2751,2757.0,from protests that were organized
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2754,2760.0,via online and social media spaces.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2757,2765.0,"And I think, for me, I'm fortunate to go"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2762,2767.0,to one of the best schools in the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2764,2770.0,And I'm deeply grateful and learn so much every day.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2767,2773.0,"But I'd probably learn just as much, if not more,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2770,2776.0,from my Twitter timeline as I do in my classes.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2773,2780.0,"I mean, there's so many smart people"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2777,2786.0,who are creating knowledge and facilitating ideas and engaging
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2783,2790.0,"with one another in a constant, 24/7 sort of way."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2787,2792.0,"So additionally, what it's also done"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2789,2794.0,is really decoupled this idea of what
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2791,2796.0,it means to be well educated as compared to well schooled.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2793,2801.0,"And so often in social movements,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2798,2804.0,we feel like it has to be someone
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2801,2806.0,"who has a PhD, or someone who went to this certain school,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2803,2811.0,"or someone who dresses this way, or has this sort of education."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2808,2816.0,"And it's like, no, actually anyone who has something to say"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2813,2818.0,can say it and can engage with--
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2815,2819.0,"I mean, you get on Twitter and you"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2816,2822.0,see like professors at Ivy League schools
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2819,2824.0,"engaging with activists in Ferguson,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2821,2826.0,and coordinating and supporting one another
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2823,2828.0,and affirming one another.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2825,2831.0,"So I think, [INAUDIBLE], I think it's hugely important."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2828,2835.0,"I don't think it, in and of itself, is an end."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2832,2837.0,But I think it has really opened up
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2834,2841.0,the space in terms of who has the ability
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2838,2844.0,"to engage in this sort of movement-building work, which"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2841,2845.0,takes all of us.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2842,2848.0,It can't be just a few people.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2845,2851.0,I think we have this ahistorical misconception
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2848,2853.0,around how the civil rights movement actually went down.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2850,2858.0,"We're like, oh, Rosa Parks sat down on the bus."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2855,2860.0,"And then they went on a march, and Martin Luther King"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2857,2861.0,had a dream.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2858,2862.0,And then everybody could vote.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2859,2864.0,"And it was great, right?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2861,2867.0,It turns into like this week-long festival.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2864,2869.0,And that's not how it was.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2866,2873.0,"It was like a lot of people beyond Dr. King,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2870,2879.0,"beyond SNCC, beyond these individuals and organizations"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2876,2883.0,that we kind of lift up who were engaging every single day
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2880,2885.0,for a very long time.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2882,2889.0,AUDIENCE: I picked the wrong spot to sit and ask a question.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2886,2894.0,"So I've been doing this stuff for a long time,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2891,2897.0,obviously from a very different vantage point than you.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2894,2898.0,Is there any reason to hope?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2895,2901.0,And it's not supposed to be yes and no question--
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2898,2903.0,answer rather.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2900,2905.0,"CLINT SMITH: No, I think it's an important question"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2902,2906.0,to grapple with.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2903,2917.0,"I think I'm someone who, while there are certainly problems"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2914,2921.0,"that exist, that have existed in this country for a long time"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2918,2927.0,and continue to exist in sort of different manifestations
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2924,2930.0,of themselves-- racism.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2927,2933.0,Racism still exists and is very pronounced in our society.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2930,2935.0,It doesn't look like it did in 1965.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2932,2939.0,"It doesn't look like in did in 1905, 1865,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2936,2940.0,but it still exists.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2937,2947.0,"But even amid that, we would be misguided"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2944,2949.0,if we didn't recognize that there
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2946,2957.0,had been immense strides made.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2954,2962.0,If you told someone not so long ago that this group of people
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2959,2965.0,would be sitting in this room at one
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2962,2967.0,"of the most powerful companies in the world,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2964,2970.0,they would have laughed you out of the room.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2967,2977.0,And so I think that while we know and we cannot ever think
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2974,2981.0,that the problems of the past have simply been swept away
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2978,2987.0,"or are gone, we also know that things have gotten better,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2984,2989.0,"and that they can, and that they will continue to."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2986,2992.0,And that there are people who have committed their lives
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2989,2996.0,"to this work, who have like in the past"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2993,2999.0,and who are doing so now and who will continue to.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2996,3002.0,"I just think if you don't have hope,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,2999,3003.0,I don't know what else you have.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3000,3005.0,Every day I wake up hopeful.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3002,3010.0,"I deeply believe that we can build a new world, that we have"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3007,3012.0,and that we will continue to.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3009,3014.0,It's going to take a lot of work.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3011,3017.0,"It's going to take probably a lot of time,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3014,3022.0,because we are pushing back against centuries
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3019,3032.0,"of pathology and deep, deep hatred and violence"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3029,3034.0,"that has been exacted against a lot of people,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3031,3040.0,and clearly exist in its own form again today.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3037,3043.0,"So yeah, I'm not someone who believes that the US is doomed"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3040,3052.0,or that we are destined for never moving
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3049,3056.0,beyond the sort of socially stratified place
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3053,3058.0,that we exist now.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3055,3061.0,I think the work that has to be done now
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3058,3064.0,is to make sure that every single person is invested
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3061,3067.0,"in that, that we can't afford to have people on the sidelines."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3064,3069.0,"We can't afford to have it so that people are saying like,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3066,3071.0,"oh, well, there's some people doing social justice"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3068,3073.0,or racial justice work.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3070,3075.0,"But you know, I work at Google."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3072,3078.0,And so that's just not my-- there
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3075,3080.0,are lots of different ways to engage in that work.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3077,3083.0,Whether it's simply having a conversation with your family
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3080,3086.0,that might not otherwise would have happened around Baltimore.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3083,3091.0,"Or, if you're in the picket line in the streets."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3088,3093.0,I think that this work can be done
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3090,3096.0,in all different sorts of ways.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3093,,And it has to.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3096,3101.0,FEMALE SPEAKER: So when generationally we
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3098,3103.0,"see favorable improvements, the challenges"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3100,3106.0,"of being a black male seem to be unchanged,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3103,3109.0,"how do we, as fathers, brothers, uncles, et cetera,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3106,3114.0,educate our sons about the world without burdening them
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3111,3117.0,with the past so they feel empowered to make a difference?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3114,3119.0,CLINT SMITH: Yeah.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3116,3121.0,"Clearly, that's been a question I've"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3118,3123.0,been thinking about and grappling
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3120,3126.0,with in some way my entire life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3123,3131.0,"But certainly, very, very acutely over the course"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3128,3134.0,of the past year.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3131,3135.0,I don't have a son.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3132,3139.0,"And if I'm fortunate enough to have a son one day,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3136,3143.0,I imagine that I will make sure that he
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3140,3148.0,knows that he is beautiful and brilliant and capable of doing
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3145,3152.0,anything that he wants to do in the world
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3149,3157.0,"while also having there be a certain level of reality,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3154,3159.0,"not in terms of what he is capable of,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3156,3162.0,"but in terms of how other people will perceive him,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3159,3166.0,and to also assure him that that has nothing to do with him.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3163,3170.0,"The way people think about you, or dehumanize you, or think"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3167,3174.0,you are capable of x or not capable of y
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3171,3177.0,is something that they have to grapple with.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3174,3181.0,"And that is not because of anything you have done,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3178,3183.0,and it's not because of who you are.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3180,3190.0,"And I think once a young person recognizes that,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3187,3194.0,then it kind of opens up the possibilities
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3191,3196.0,of how they imagine themselves navigating the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3193,3199.0,"Because even for me, I'm continuously"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3196,3203.0,unlearning so many things that I grew up
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3200,3206.0,thinking about my own community and myself
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3203,3212.0,about what I was and wasn't capable of in these ways
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3209,3214.0,that we wouldn't even necessarily recognize.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3211,3219.0,But I'm spending my days sitting in libraries
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3216,3222.0,for like 12 hours a day thinking about this stuff now.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3219,3225.0,And I'm sitting with some of these thoughts and ideas
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3222,3230.0,and recognizing I inundated and was socialized
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3227,3233.0,under certain pathologies about what black masculinity was
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3230,3236.0,and how I should be in the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3233,3239.0,"And so every day, I'm trying to step out of myself"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3236,3243.0,and make sure that I am not accepting that.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3240,3247.0,And I want to have a conversation with my sons
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3244,3250.0,and my nephews and my cousins.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3247,3255.0,"Hopefully, sharing with them these things"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3252,3259.0,that I am constantly trying to unlearn for myself.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3256,3264.0,"Because again, the problem is not the child."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3261,3266.0,The problem is the world that perceives
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3263,3268.0,the child a certain way.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3265,3272.0,"Again, like my final poem, we don't have to change the kids."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3269,3274.0,We have to change the world.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3271,3275.0,That sounded so cheesy.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3272,3276.0,[LAUGHTER]
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3273,3277.0,FEMALE SPEAKER: It was good.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3274,3278.0,OK.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3275,3283.0,AUDIENCE: So your art is very inspiring.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3280,3285.0,Activism is another tool that can really
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3282,3286.0,address a lot of things.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3283,3290.0,But another tool that I don't think a lot of people discuss
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3287,3293.0,is policy change from governments and powers that be.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3290,3295.0,But a lot of their decision making
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3292,3299.0,happens with vetted data.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3296,3304.0,And a lot of what is fed to them is anecdotal in some sense.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3301,3307.0,"Do you feel that companies, large tech companies"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3304,3311.0,"like Google, have an ethical and moral obligation"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3308,3314.0,to take our resources and the power
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3311,3318.0,"that we have at our disposal and illuminate this ground data,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3315,3321.0,"this ground truth, so that policymakers can actually"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3318,3322.0,make more informed decisions about what's
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3319,3325.0,happening to their people?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3322,3328.0,CLINT SMITH: I would argue yes.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3325,3332.0,I think the nature of capitalism and the free market
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3329,3335.0,might dictate otherwise.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3332,3338.0,"The question always becomes, is this"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3335,3339.0,helpful for the bottom line?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3336,3341.0,Are we going to make more money?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3338,3342.0,Are we going to expand?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3339,3344.0,Are we going to scale?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3341,3350.0,"And for me, it's a question of, both individually"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3347,3353.0,"and on a more macro level, what type of person"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3350,3356.0,and what type of organization do you want to be?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3353,3358.0,Just like on certain terms of core principles.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3355,3361.0,Because there's certain ways that companies
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3358,3364.0,can and should act if they just want to make a lot of money.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3361,3366.0,It's very clear that there are certain things you should do
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3363,3368.0,and certain things you should not do.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3365,3371.0,"But the question is, here at Google"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3368,3375.0,"and around the world is, what type of organization and what"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3372,3379.0,type of things do we want to represent as an organization
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3376,3381.0,to the broader world that might not necessarily
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3378,3383.0,be quantifiable?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3380,3386.0,That might not necessarily show up in the quarterly report
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3383,3389.0,"and aren't going to be in an Excel sheet,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3386,3397.0,but that are going to send a message to our employees
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3394,3401.0,and to the world at large that we are committed to something
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3398,3402.0,much bigger than ourselves.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3399,3407.0,"Because at the end of the day, if you make a lot of money,"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3404,3408.0,you make a lot of money.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3405,3410.0,"But then, we're all mortal."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3407,3413.0,And we're all going to move on to something else
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3410,3416.0,after this life.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3413,3421.0,"And for me, it's like, what do I want to leave behind?"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3418,3425.0,And how can I leave something behind that
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3422,3428.0,represents something that's bigger
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3425,3432.0,"than myself, both as a person and for the institutions"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3429,3436.0,that I represent?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3433,3439.0,I don't know too much about the infrastructure of Google
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3436,3442.0,"in that regard, but I've certainly"
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3439,3445.0,heard some hopeful anecdotes and some stories
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3442,3451.0,that sound like you have a group of people
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3448,3454.0,who are at least committed to thinking about that.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3451,3455.0,I'm here.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3452,3458.0,"I'm sitting here, so that must mean something."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3455,3460.0,"FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, thank you so much for your time."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3457,3463.0,My phone has been blowing up with questions and people
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3460,3464.0,saying that they loved the talk.
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3461,3465.0,And is it being recorded?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3462,3466.0,Is this being captured?
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3463,3469.0,"Like, we need to have these conversations here."
lTj6N1Im4FU,Poetry Slam Champion | Clint Smith | Talks at Google,3466,3470.0,So thank you for coming out.

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,257,264.0,to post a question to the speakers.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,261,268.0,What we'll do is we'll hear from each of the speakers in turn
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,265,271.0,and then we'll try and look at the questions that have come
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,268,274.0,"through from you, our audience, and then I'll try and bundle them"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,271,279.0,together and try and curate and host
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,276,283.0,that question and answer session that will follow thereafter.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,280,286.0,So there is a limit of the technology that sometimes we get these
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,283,290.0,slightly jump transitions so try and bear
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,287,293.0,"with us, we'll hopefully try and give you much of a in the room"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,290,296.0,experiences we possibly can.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,293,300.0,"So without further ado, move to our first"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,297,303.0,"speaker, who's going to talk to us on the nature"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,300,307.0,of the evidence and we'll hear from Professor Sue Dawson.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,304,312.0,"So over to you Sue, thank you."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,309,319.0,"[Professor Sue Dawson] Thanks John. First slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,316,322.0,We understand climate changes and the impact
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,319,327.0,"on the environment much more than we ever had, the climate"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,324,330.0,debate is all around us and we need to think about whether
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,327,334.0,we have answers to many of these bigger questions.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,331,338.0,Do we understand the uncertainties around environmental changes
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,335,342.0,or we are comfortable with the changes that exist around
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,339,345.0,us? We're all living with environmental change at a global

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,454,461.0,This loss of ice is both a symptom of climate change
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,458,465.0,as well as a driver of the change because the ice reflects the heat

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,468,474.0,We see record losses of permafrost associated with these
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,471,479.0,temperatures as well and this accelerates the thaw
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,476,482.0,and unlocks stores of carbon and methane.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,479,485.0,That's when we send more into the atmosphere.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,482,489.0,We understand much about the importance of forests and since
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,486,493.0,1990 there's been over one hundred and seventy million hectares

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,577,583.0,"That was excellent. So, audience, I think we've got the case"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,580,588.0,for the fact that we've got this unprecedented
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,585,591.0,level of change within our global climate system.

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,605,612.0,"Yeah, thank you. This is yeah, the goverment has said this"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,609,614.0,is an unprecedented challenge.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,611,617.0,It's actually the largest and most demanding
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,614,621.0,task that humanity has ever set itself and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,618,623.0,this is the response so far.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,620,628.0,It is about making new international law
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,625,632.0,to signal to everyone that this is an irreversible
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,629,634.0,and transformative process.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,631,638.0,This is based on international law conventions and particularly
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,635,641.0,the Paris agreement in 2015.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,638,644.0,I can't go into many details about this but the key thing is that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,641,648.0,every state in the world is party to it
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,645,652.0,and most importantly also the largest emitters.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,649,655.0,"Now, this is, this slide shows you"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,652,659.0,that the US has recently rejoined this treaty and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,656,663.0,the message that this sends is hard to overestimate.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,660,666.0,"This is for all states, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,663,669.0,"particularly as a matter of fairness, those that have the most to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,666,671.0,contribute.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,668,673.0,"Next slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,670,677.0,"Yeah, and how does the how does the Paris agreement approach this"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,674,680.0,task? It's fundamentally bottom up so every
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,677,683.0,state determines its own contribution.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,680,687.0,It sets it's level of ambition and then it
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,684,691.0,is subject to accountability to all
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,688,694.0,"others, its peer pressure that works best, and this"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,691,699.0,is the registry of these nationally determined contributions
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,696,702.0,or indices. You see them state
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,699,707.0,by state and can see exactly what everyone is ready to contribute.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,704,712.0,"Next slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,709,715.0,Another important thing about the Paris agreement is that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,712,719.0,"it sets an objective, an objective about where to hold"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,716,722.0,"the climate, the global temperature rise."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,719,725.0,Now that's incredibly important. It's a great step forward by the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,722,729.0,"Paris agreement, but it gives us choice and you see this"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,726,732.0,here as the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,729,736.0,objective can be between two degrees Celsius global
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,733,739.0,warming or one point five degrees.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,736,743.0,This is a huge difference and the question is still which
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,740,746.0,one the international community will commit to.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,743,750.0,The slides here give you a chance on an image
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,747,754.0,of what needs to be done to remain at
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,751,757.0,"one point to hit this target of the sweet spot if I may say so, one"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,754,761.0,"point five degrees global warming, and you effectively see"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,758,763.0,on this slide that's been prepared by the International Energy
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,760,767.0,Agency. You see that this is fundamentally
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,764,771.0,"about if we want to go for 2015,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,768,775.0,"that's your that's your target,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,772,778.0,then the action must happen by 2030.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,775,782.0,That's really what we should aim for and you see that there
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,779,784.0,are three big sectors.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,781,787.0,The contribution that's the largest contribution from the power
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,784,791.0,"sector, new and used, is demanding effectively"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,788,794.0,"disruptive technologies, but also behaviour"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,791,798.0,change. So these three sectors must work together
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,795,802.0,"to achieve that target and of course, that is exactly"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,799,805.0,what Glasgow COP26 coming
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,802,808.0,up in November is all about.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,805,810.0,"Thank you, John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,807,812.0,"[Professor John Rowan] Thank you, Volker."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,809,816.0,Excellent. So that audience is the the global
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,813,820.0,governing frameworks within which we're trying to respond to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,817,822.0,the climate change emergency.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,819,825.0,We're going to come down in scale now and I'll bring you over
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,822,829.0,to Professor Peter Fox who is going to explore
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,826,832.0,with us some of the national policy and practise developments that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,829,835.0,he's very familiar with.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,832,839.0,"So, thank you Pete."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,836,844.0,"[Professor Pete Fox] Thank you, John. Next slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,841,848.0,"So I work for the Environment Agency, it's"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,845,852.0,a large environmental regulator covering the whole of England.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,849,856.0,This slide shows our responsibilities
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,853,860.0,when it comes to managing carbon and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,857,864.0,I would like to draw your attention to the second
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,861,869.0,"series of rings, the purple,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,866,872.0,"orangey red and green, and those are the three principal"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,869,875.0,responsibilities of the environment agency.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,872,879.0,"So, as a regulator we regulate the power industry"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,876,883.0,and the chemical industry and most other big
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,880,887.0,emitters of carbon dioxide and our job
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,884,890.0,is to set for them limits on
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,887,895.0,emissions of key pollutants and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,892,898.0,so we are working with them to regulate and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,895,903.0,innovate for carbon emissions.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,900,907.0,We are responsible for managing the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,904,911.0,trading scheme for carbon across the UK
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,908,914.0,and we are pushing hard for a circular
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,911,919.0,economy through our regulatory responsibilities.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,916,922.0,"We're also an operator, we build flood defences"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,919,926.0,and we set targets for
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,923,930.0,flood resilience around England and in building
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,927,933.0,"our flood defences, we clearly do modelling and management"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,930,937.0,of river levels and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,934,941.0,"in so doing, actually, we use an awful lot of concrete, which"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,938,945.0,itself is a carbon intensive material but
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,942,949.0,"we are adapting to during our operational activities, adapting"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,946,953.0,to a changing climate.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,950,957.0,"But more importantly, as a leader in environmental regulation our"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,954,961.0,responsibility is to walk the walk ourselves and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,958,965.0,we have committed to becoming a net zero organisation by
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,962,969.0,"2030, some 20 years earlier"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,966,972.0,than the UK government and we are an arm's length body of UK
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,969,976.0,government and setting that 2030 target was
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,973,980.0,a politically very sensitive two years ago and we're on that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,977,982.0,road now.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,979,984.0,"Next slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,981,988.0,So I'd like to offer you three observations
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,985,992.0,and reflections on the early journey to get to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,989,994.0,net zero.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,991,998.0,[Professor John Rowan] Can I just interrupt you a second? My my slide show is
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,995,1002.0,showing a blurred image and just making
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,999,1007.0,sure you could possibly just be me.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1004,1009.0,[Professor Pete Fox] How's it looking?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1006,1012.0,"[Professor John Rowan] I think we're just having a slight technical problem, but"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1009,1016.0,of course you can please just carry on Pete and then later
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1013,1018.0,we'll catch up with you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1015,1023.0,"[Professor Pete Fox] You're not missing anything particularly pretty, folks There"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1020,1027.0,"are three bullet points on this slide, the first is the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1024,1029.0,policy is easy.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1026,1032.0,"It's easy to set the net zero policy, it is quite something"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1029,1036.0,else to actually implement it and what we are seeing
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1033,1039.0,now is an awful lot of debate within government and across government
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1036,1044.0,on how you implement a policy of net zero.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1041,1048.0,"The Crown Commercial Service, the driver of the procurement"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1045,1051.0,"for the government, are now starting to wake up to the fact that they"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1048,1055.0,are going to have to drive very hard their procurement
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1052,1059.0,"to achieve net zero, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1056,1062.0,"frankly, they are finding it incredibly difficult"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1059,1067.0,to make that jump and we're helping them with that.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1064,1071.0,The second is that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1068,1075.0,"actually as the UK economy, it's quite straightforward"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1072,1079.0,for us to set ourselves a net zero
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1076,1083.0,target because we've off shored much of our
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1080,1085.0,carbon emissions.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1082,1089.0,Manufacturing is largely undertaken in Asia
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1086,1092.0,and China in particular and so we need to be very careful
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1089,1096.0,that we don't we don't look at our progress towards
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1093,1100.0,"an net zero and start to polish our halos, because"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1097,1104.0,to be honest we are exporting
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1101,1109.0,"our emissions, they're happening elsewhere."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1106,1111.0,"Thirdly, reporting is tough."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1108,1115.0,Accounting is vague and uncertain and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1112,1119.0,so actually getting a standard set of
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1116,1123.0,accounting measures and accounting for offsetting
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1120,1125.0,is very difficult.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1122,1128.0,There is no standard out there and so it's easy for people
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1125,1132.0,"to double count, triple count their contributions."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1129,1135.0,So let me give you an example. We anticipate that in the environment
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1132,1139.0,"agency, we will achieve a further reduction by up to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1136,1143.0,"45 percent of our total emissions by 2030,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1140,1145.0,"meaning we were going to have to, we are going to have to, try and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1142,1149.0,find offsetting for 55 percent.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1146,1153.0,We estimate that 55 percent
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1150,1157.0,of carbon emissions translated to tree planting
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1154,1160.0,would require more trees planted than
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1157,1165.0,all that were planted in the whole of the UK last year and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1162,1169.0,"so actually, we think the challenge of achieving net zero"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1166,1174.0,is huge and will test us all.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1171,1176.0,"Thank you, John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1173,1177.0,"[Professor John Rowan] Thank you, Pete."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1174,1181.0,"Apologies audience for the slight technical hiccup there, these"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1178,1184.0,things happen with very large numbers.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1181,1187.0,So an excellent overview of the of the UK
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1184,1191.0,"position and thank you very much, Pete Fox, and now we're going to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1188,1194.0,"move to our final speaker, who's Professor Mel Woods, and she's"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1191,1198.0,going to share her experiences around developing
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1195,1202.0,a very significant programme of citizen activation
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1199,1205.0,and citizen science responses to climate change.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1202,1208.0,"So, thank you Mel, over to you."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1205,1211.0,"[Professor Mel Woods] Thank you, John. Yes, good evening everybody and I'm very"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1208,1215.0,happy to be here. So I'm going to talk a little bit about people and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1212,1220.0,"agency and, most importantly I think, the effects"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1217,1223.0,that the impending or the climate disaster that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1220,1227.0,"we're facing can often have, which can be quite debilitating."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1224,1230.0,"You might wonder as an individual, what actually can I do"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1227,1234.0,about this? Is it going to make any difference that I cycle
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1231,1237.0,"to work every day like I do, or that I"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1234,1241.0,use reusable bags instead of plastic bags
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1238,1246.0,or even that I try to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1243,1250.0,buy differently for instance. What difference can that actually make?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1247,1252.0,Is that a drop in the ocean too far?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1249,1253.0,What about governments?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1250,1256.0,What about industry? What are they doing?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1253,1260.0,One of the real areas of
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1257,1263.0,transformation that we're seeing that has actually been around for a
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1260,1267.0,very long time began with the great
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1264,1268.0,bird count.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1265,1273.0,That was a leisure activity designed by the Victorians
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1270,1276.0,to count birds at Christmas and has since built
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1273,1280.0,up a huge data set of patterns of bird
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1277,1284.0,"migration and other initiatives, such as the bee"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1281,1287.0,"count where you, and many of you, may have taken part going out into"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1284,1291.0,your gardens in the summer to spot bees and respond to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1288,1294.0,the Natural History Museum's index in order to see which
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1291,1296.0,bees are thriving and which are not.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1293,1300.0,Those are examples of citizen science and citizen science is
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1297,1303.0,"going through not only a renaissance, but a transformation"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1300,1307.0,in the way that citizens are collaborating
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1304,1311.0,with scientists and actually meeting some of these data challenges
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1308,1314.0,that Pete started to talk about there in a really interesting
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1311,1318.0,"way and has the potential, we think, to contribute"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1315,1322.0,to the development and the measuring of some of the indicators
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1319,1325.0,and breaking down into the smaller chunks of the Sustainable
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1322,1328.0,"Development Goals, the UN's SDGs."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1325,1332.0,"So citizen science has the potential, it grounded itself"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1329,1336.0,in ecology but the difference is now is that citizens
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1333,1338.0,and the role of citizens have become embedded.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1335,1342.0,It's becoming a far more collaborative and cocreated
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1339,1346.0,"endeavour between individuals, communities and science"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1343,1349.0,themselves and even local authorities are getting involved
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1346,1353.0,and they're experiencing coming into projects and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1350,1357.0,being involved because of experiencing everyday issues in their lives
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1354,1358.0,that they feel are important to them.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1355,1362.0,So we have been developing projects starting with things like air

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1363,1369.0,with a real change-making agenda and designing the process of science
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1366,1372.0,and the gathering of data together.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1369,1375.0,Here you can see it with GROW we've been working on soil.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1372,1379.0,So we developed quite early on a value system where
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1376,1383.0,"we're looking not only to meet the top down scientific agenda, but"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1380,1386.0,"also the bottom up community agenda, which is supporting"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1383,1390.0,"a movement of citizens and communities, generating and sharing"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1387,1393.0,and using data and in the GROW observatory the example is on
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1390,1397.0,soil health and growing and land practises.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1394,1401.0,"If we can move to the next slide, please."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1398,1404.0,So one of the things that we do and believe in very strongly is open
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1401,1408.0,"science and open science means using, for us as"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1405,1412.0,"designers and makers, open hardware, open software."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1409,1416.0,"So open hardware might be sensors, open software is is anybody"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1413,1419.0,"can design and contribute to software, opening up"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1416,1422.0,"the science, opening up the tools and the methods and the resources"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1419,1426.0,and our aim is to share best practices
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1423,1429.0,and toolkits so that anyone can use those.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1426,1432.0,Anyone can take part and learn and anyone can join
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1429,1436.0,a citizen science project and here is one example that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1433,1440.0,we're extremely proud of 'Citizen Science Projects: How to make

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1442,1449.0,this year and this has been a fantastic training resource
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1446,1453.0,"for many of the people that have joined, not only from citizens,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1450,1455.0,but also from scientific organisations.

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1454,1460.0,But who are the people that join
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1457,1462.0,and who are the people that have made change?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1459,1467.0,Here we can see just a selection of the 24 communities
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1464,1472.0,"that have placed over 6000 sensors in the past three years, gathering"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1469,1475.0,millions of rows of data in order to monitor soil moisture
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1472,1479.0,"and actually ground truth Sentinel-1, which is the family of"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1476,1482.0,satellites that are monitoring the kinds of extreme

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1484,1491.0,and warming events that are threatening and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1488,1494.0,as a result of climate change. You can see them here from all over
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1491,1498.0,"the world and we have one, of course, here in Scotland"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1495,1500.0,in Angus just up the road.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1497,1504.0,So their stories are extremely important as stories of success and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1501,1508.0,"we use design, art, storytelling,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1505,1511.0,"data visualisation, as Sue as described previously, in order to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1508,1514.0,"spread and scale, but that is the challenge."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1511,1518.0,How do we as individuals get involved in these initiatives?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1515,1521.0,How do we spread and how do we scale and engage people
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1518,1525.0,around us? and how do we really create a global
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1522,1528.0,movement of resilience in order to gather this kind
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1525,1532.0,"of data, to make evidence, use that data for ourselves and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1529,1535.0,"give that data also to science and on that note, I shall end."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1532,1537.0,Thank you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1534,1539.0,"[Professor John Rowan] Thank you very much, Mel."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1536,1541.0,So back to me.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1538,1545.0,"Thank you, our speakers, I think we've heard from"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1542,1549.0,"four internationally renowned experts, each with specific"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1546,1552.0,domain knowledge in their respective areas and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1549,1556.0,we're on a very broad canvas with respect to the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1553,1559.0,climate emergency and how we generate responses to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1556,1564.0,"it. When we did the initial registration,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1561,1567.0,"as we mentioned, there was something in the order of 400"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1564,1570.0,registrations made for tonight's event and one of the things that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1567,1574.0,happened with that is we invited colleagues to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1571,1576.0,pre post questions that they may have for the panel.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1573,1580.0,So we've got dozens of questions that have come in from the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1577,1583.0,pre-registration process and a number
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1580,1587.0,"of those I've actually posted into the chat already, just"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1584,1590.0,"to seed the pot as it were, and then we've had"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1587,1594.0,a significant number of questions now coming in from from
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1591,1598.0,yourselves in the audience. So I think what we'll do is
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1595,1602.0,just begin with the question from
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1599,1606.0,"Joe, which is how is the economic effect"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1603,1609.0,of COVID going to affect our ability to achieve net zero
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1606,1612.0,and the other changes that we need to make?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1609,1616.0,"So I'm going to start with you, Pete, and then I'm going to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1613,1620.0,move across to the other members of the panel and maybe just take
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1617,1623.0,each and turn. My original idea is that we would have come to each
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1620,1627.0,of you for your respective talk but I think considering where we are
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1624,1630.0,in terms of the schedule we'll just start with a general question
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1627,1632.0,then we'll move it through the panel.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1629,1635.0,"So if I could start with you first, Pete, economic affect of COVID"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1632,1638.0,affecting our ability to achieve the net
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1635,1642.0,zero targets. Thank you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1639,1644.0,Thank you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1641,1649.0,"[Professor Pete Fox] Gosh, yes, I think there has"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1646,1653.0,been a real tension around delivering public
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1650,1656.0,"goods and generating taxation, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1653,1661.0,traditionally I think taxation has been level of employment and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1658,1665.0,I think the Government and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1662,1669.0,the Treasury actually in the UK Government have cottoned
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1666,1673.0,on to the need to link taxation
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1670,1677.0,to climate and they are
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1674,1680.0,"driving that quite hard, as well as a public"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1677,1684.0,policy around investment in
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1681,1690.0,"carbon neutral energy technologies, and,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1687,1695.0,"I must say, I am cautiously optimistic actually around"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1692,1698.0,the way this government is driving public good.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1695,1702.0,It will be really interesting to see whether the budget next week
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1699,1705.0,changes the landscape on taxation and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1702,1709.0,"if that doesn't, I would expect the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1706,1713.0,British government to do something quite totemic
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1710,1718.0,for COP26 in Glasgow later this year.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1715,1720.0,They've been actually remarkably quiet in the last four or five
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1717,1724.0,months about taxation and its driver
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1721,1728.0,"for carbon, despite the fact there are a number of"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1725,1732.0,select committees and audit committees
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1729,1734.0,that are driving it very hard.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1731,1736.0,"I hope that helps, John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1733,1738.0,[Professor John Rowan] I think I think it does help.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1735,1741.0,It was very good Pete and I'm going to bridge across now from that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1738,1745.0,response to Volker and building a question that came
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1742,1748.0,"from an audience member, Rowan,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1745,1751.0,which was talking about the idea of carbon and making it more
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1748,1755.0,"understood within the community. So, Volker, I wonder in terms"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1752,1759.0,of your expertise in national and international regulation
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1756,1763.0,"and the ways in which you can use policy to affect change,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1760,1766.0,would you like to just pick up the ideas
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1763,1770.0,there that Pete was developing around how we actually make a
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1767,1773.0,formal response?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1770,1777.0,"[Professor Volker Roeben] Yeah, thank you very much, John and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1774,1780.0,Pete. I think this is the response is twofold.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1777,1784.0,We need both. We need regulation and we need
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1781,1788.0,"a new, large push of investment and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1785,1791.0,regulation means effectively suppression of carbon and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1788,1795.0,that's done quite effectively in many countries now
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1792,1798.0,through a cap put on the large emitters.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1795,1802.0,"The emissions trading system, I can't go into details here,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1799,1804.0,but that's being spread out across the world.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1801,1808.0,"We have that in Europe, we have that in China now coming on stream."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1805,1813.0,"That's the regulatory part, but in fact that which"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1810,1817.0,is really required in addition to this is a complete
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1814,1821.0,resteering of investment away from traditional industries
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1818,1824.0,towards low carbon energy and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1821,1828.0,"other industry forms. That's the key thing, it's it's an order of"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1825,1832.0,trillions and the interesting and maybe paradoxical
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1829,1835.0,effect of the Covid pandemic is that governments have been looking
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1832,1839.0,at this in a much more favourable way than they would otherwise have
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1836,1842.0,done. So we see
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1839,1846.0,governments across the world trying to respond to the crisis
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1843,1849.0,by investing in large scale investment and that investment
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1846,1853.0,"is done, is to be channelled and that's actually"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1850,1857.0,largely happening into the right energy
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1854,1860.0,"forms in particular, but other other technologies as well."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1857,1865.0,You see this in President Biden's plan and decisions here and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1862,1866.0,that's that is the key thing.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1863,1870.0,In addition to to the governments
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1867,1874.0,pledging this also as green
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1871,1877.0,"finance for developing countries, very important."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1874,1881.0,"That's government money, but it's actually only leveraging"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1878,1885.0,the much more important private sector fund money
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1882,1888.0,that the main investment has to come from this private sector and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1885,1892.0,that requires a clear taxonomy of what is actually
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1889,1894.0,desirable in finance.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1891,1897.0,"All of this needs to be agreed at the international level, COP26"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1894,1901.0,"is the right place, so let's hope we get the right"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1898,1903.0,outcomes there. Thank you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1900,1905.0,[Professor John Rowan] Thank you. Thank you very much Volker.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1902,1909.0,"I mean, you raise a very interesting question"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1906,1913.0,when you characterise the global response and the many new
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1910,1917.0,policy instruments and economic instruments that are being developed
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1914,1921.0,"across the world. But it's interesting, when we...and you evoked"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1918,1925.0,"Joe Biden, the new president of the US is critical"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1922,1929.0,in terms of a unified global response.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1926,1933.0,"And yet, one of the questions that came in from the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1930,1936.0,audience prior to starting was making reference to the former
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1933,1940.0,"president of the US who denied the existence of global warming, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1937,1944.0,"so maybe I'll come to Sue from the science perspective,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1941,1948.0,just to remind us about the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1945,1953.0,nature of the evidence and ask her the question as a
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1950,1956.0,"professional educator, how much time and effort,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1953,1960.0,"Sue, do you think still needs to be expended to actually"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1957,1963.0,educating people about the nature of the problem?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1960,1967.0,and then I think we should then pick up that idea of where
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1964,1970.0,how impacts are playing out across the world in the north and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1967,1974.0,"in the global south. So first of all, Sue, on the educating"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1971,1978.0,"people about the problem, tell us what you're doing in"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1975,1983.0,your world please.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1980,1987.0,[Professor Sue Dawson] Thanks John. It is a really good question and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1984,1991.0,I think education of
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1988,1994.0,the climate emergency starts at a very young age
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1991,1998.0,in primary schools and through our young people
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1995,2002.0,"and we see, you know, the passions that young people have with the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,1999,2005.0,"growth of, you know in Greta Thunberg, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2002,2008.0,the Extinction Rebellion and all those students.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2005,2013.0,"As you know, we like to see our students as activists and we see"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2010,2017.0,that as a kind of growing concern and then
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2014,2020.0,"using, you know, thinking"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2017,2024.0,then through the impacts of climate change
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2021,2028.0,on us as individuals I think is a really good way to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2025,2031.0,"look at some of the science, because the science"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2028,2036.0,is complex and there are still unknowns and how
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2033,2040.0,different parts of the ocean and the atmosphere work together
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2037,2044.0,and behave in ways that we sometimes still don't
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2041,2046.0,absolutely understand.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2043,2050.0,But the use of things like the visualisations of the temperature
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2047,2053.0,changes through scientists like Ed
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2050,2057.0,Hawkins really are bringing an
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2054,2060.0,"understanding of the temperature changes to a much,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2057,2062.0,much wider audience.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2059,2066.0,I think starting with our young people
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2063,2071.0,and then they provide the impetus to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2068,2074.0,educate amongst their own families and then
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2071,2079.0,that kind of escalates and people are really
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2076,2082.0,"worried about climate. They want to make an impact, they want to do"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2079,2087.0,something and I think that can only be a good thing.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2084,2091.0,"[Professor John Rowan] OK, thank you, Sue. I think we're going to return to the to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2088,2095.0,"the question of individual agency, but I want us to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2092,2098.0,respond to a number of questions that have been coming in from the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2095,2102.0,audience in respect of agricultural
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2099,2108.0,practises and we've got evidence of extensification
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2105,2112.0,and intensification of agriculture in different parts
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2109,2115.0,of the world. I think we saw some questions
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2112,2119.0,about exploring the role of animal agriculture
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2116,2123.0,"on the climate, I think we see some questions about"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2120,2126.0,the condition of the soil base within the planet as we go
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2123,2130.0,towards increasing levels of intensification
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2127,2135.0,and the consequences there may be to soil and biodiversity
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2132,2138.0,"and we saw a number of questions, for example, from Siobhan and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2135,2142.0,about asking us to specifically consider the role of food in
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2139,2146.0,agriculture and land use in both the generation
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2143,2149.0,of greenhouse gases but also as a sink for
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2146,2153.0,"sequestration. So maybe I'll come to you, Mel, you've done a lot"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2150,2156.0,of work in this space looking at the role of soil
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2153,2160.0,in agriculture and growing as a practise
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2157,2162.0,of adaptation and response.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2159,2165.0,So do you want to just pick up a number of the questions that are
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2162,2169.0,coming forward that we can see in the chat bar?
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2166,2171.0,"[Professor Mel Woods] OK, thanks, John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2168,2175.0,"Well in fact, you are the soil scientist but I'll try to step in as"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2172,2178.0,the designer who's been working in that space.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2175,2182.0,"I think, first of all, just something I'd like to say about"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2179,2187.0,what's generally in response to Covid and understanding
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2184,2191.0,"data. I think we're far more equipped, I'm quite positive, I think"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2188,2196.0,we're far more equipped than we ever have been before as
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2193,2199.0,a society in understanding the importance
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2196,2203.0,of data and looking at data on a regular
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2200,2206.0,"daily, somewhat hourly basis at certain points in the last year."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2203,2210.0,"So we're more equipped, I think, to understand"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2207,2213.0,"data, to understand the measures, even if we don't like them, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2210,2217.0,to maybe understand why certain decisions have to be made.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2214,2221.0,So it's on that basis that I think
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2218,2225.0,"from my perspective, I think we have been working with communities"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2222,2229.0,across Europe and in some of the education resources
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2226,2231.0,globally.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2228,2235.0,It's clear that many of the people who
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2232,2238.0,join in on those courses are really interested
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2235,2241.0,in nature based solutions to some of these problems.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2238,2245.0,Volker alluded to some of that and in
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2242,2248.0,"the U.K. and specifically in Scotland last year,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2245,2252.0,all of our local authorities published both
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2249,2256.0,a biodiversity and food strategy plans as to how
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2253,2261.0,we start to move towards a more carbon neutral
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2258,2265.0,"regeneration of our soils, regeneration of biodiversity."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2262,2269.0,"But of course, we're also relying on policy in"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2266,2274.0,order to underpin that in terms of some
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2271,2277.0,of our big agricultural producers.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2274,2280.0,So it's bringing all of that together and I can
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2277,2284.0,see there are some questions about whether it's unfair
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2281,2288.0,for a civil community to be held responsible for the climate
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2285,2292.0,"emergency, I think absolutely, but as Sue has said many"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2289,2295.0,people do want to do something. They want to be
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2292,2298.0,able to actually make a difference when issues are starting to to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2295,2300.0,touch their lives.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2297,2304.0,"So, yes, it is unfair for the civil community alone"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2301,2307.0,to be held responsible but I think we can all do something and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2304,2311.0,"we can try to make those changes in our lives that we know,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2308,2316.0,"can try, can start to make a difference."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2313,2320.0,"Coming to the question of soil, of"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2317,2324.0,"course, the UN FAO announced maybe five"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2321,2327.0,"or six years ago, quite controversially actually, that we had only"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2324,2330.0,100 harvests left.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2327,2334.0,"But of course, the way in which agriculture"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2331,2337.0,has operated is an increasing intensification and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2334,2342.0,"on the one hand, you could argue that that has actually succeeded"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2339,2345.0,in driving down the costs of food and so people can afford
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2342,2349.0,"to eat. You know, the poorest in our society can actually afford"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2346,2353.0,to buy good quality food but at the other end
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2350,2356.0,"of the scale, I think there's a real recognition that these things"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2353,2360.0,have to change. I think if any of you do follow
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2357,2364.0,"James Rebanks, who's famously written"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2361,2367.0,"a book, is The Herdy Shepherd on social media he speaks"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2364,2371.0,very eloquently from his farm in the Lake District
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2368,2375.0,about the generations of his family

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2378,2384.0,"the soil, but speaks very eloquently on the change that needs to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2381,2388.0,"happen. So there are voices coming through into policy, very"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2385,2393.0,much so into society and I think we recognise
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2390,2397.0,"all of that and I'm really hoping, actually, that"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2394,2400.0,"the evidence from our own project, the GROW Observatory, that we have"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2397,2404.0,communities still monitoring soil a year after funding
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2401,2407.0,ends. That date has been taken up by climate science and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2404,2409.0,by the by satellite science.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2406,2412.0,"Really, real evidence that the individuals can make a change."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2409,2416.0,"You can join a community initiative, you can follow"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2413,2420.0,your local authority's biodiversity and food strategy and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2417,2423.0,actually contribute to a greater good.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2420,2426.0,So I hope that ties in some of the questions that are appearing
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2423,2430.0,"at the side there. So thank you, back to John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2427,2432.0,"[Professor John Rowan] Thank you. Thank you, Mel."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2429,2436.0,That does tie a number of questions in really very nicely.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2433,2440.0,I think that we have been concerned about climate
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2437,2442.0,change for so long.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2439,2445.0,We see evidence of government response
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2442,2448.0,now developing. So we've seen even our own Scottish Government
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2445,2452.0,publishing its climate change plan as recently
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2449,2456.0,"as December 2020, which sets the ambition around new"

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2467,2474.0,"can often talk about the public sector role, about"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2471,2476.0,the role of government.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2473,2479.0,There was a very early question from Catherine that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2476,2484.0,is kind of provoking our panel to consider
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2481,2488.0,how we channel energy into influencing
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2485,2491.0,business and industry to accelerate their progress towards
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2488,2494.0,"net zero, as well as there's a critical sector of the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2491,2497.0,agriculture sector that we've touched upon.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2494,2501.0,"Clearly, there's appitite in the public sector"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2498,2504.0,"and around governmental response, but actually, critically, we're"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2501,2508.0,also going to need individuals and businesses to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2505,2511.0,"get on board with that as well. So let me come to you, Volker, if I"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2508,2515.0,"may, to just maybe begin to address Catherine's"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2512,2518.0,question about how we channel energies into
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2515,2522.0,influencing business and industry to accelerate towards net
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2519,2524.0,zero. Thank you.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2521,2526.0,"[Professor Volker Roeben] Thank you, John. Yes, there are several."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2523,2528.0,This is a very interesting question and there are several responses
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2525,2530.0,to this.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2527,2534.0,Most of us are in one way or another part of a
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2531,2538.0,institution that is invested
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2535,2543.0,in carbon relevant technologies and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2540,2547.0,it is therefore up to us to bring
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2544,2551.0,about a change in that investment and to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2548,2555.0,push for divestment as well from certain
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2552,2558.0,"fossil fuels. That's something that's happening, for instance, here"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2555,2561.0,at the University that did happen.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2558,2565.0,That's a matter of pressure from below and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2562,2567.0,that's a large scale issue as well.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2564,2570.0,"Investment, you know, what is it?"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2567,2574.0,"pension funds, all of them make decisions"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2571,2576.0,and all of them have a choice.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2573,2580.0,What I wanted to highlight as well as that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2577,2584.0,individual consumer preferences in
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2581,2587.0,many sectors of the economy are absolutely critical and often
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2584,2588.0,overlooked.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2585,2592.0,"Now, many of these thrust disruptive technologies"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2589,2596.0,are only coming on stream because consumers saw want
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2593,2600.0,"and you may have followed this, there has been an announcement from"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2597,2604.0,"General Motors, the largest car manufacturer in the world,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2601,2607.0,"that by 2025, 2025, that's"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2604,2611.0,"only four years from now, it will have 30"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2608,2614.0,new electric vehicle models on
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2611,2618.0,the market and that's then for everyone.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2615,2622.0,So there will be an electric vehicle to purchase for everyone
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2619,2626.0,"from that manufacturer, and in fact, that is not because they"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2623,2628.0,particularly like electric vehicles.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2625,2631.0,"In fact, they make less money on that than on the classic petrol car"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2628,2635.0,but because they have concluded that consumer
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2632,2638.0,preferences have shifted in such a decisive
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2635,2642.0,way that there's no way they cannot
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2639,2646.0,make these new offers and you could name any legacy
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2643,2649.0,car manufacturer doing exactly that.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2646,2653.0,So the fundamental transformative
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2650,2656.0,shift in consumer preferences is
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2653,2660.0,an absolutely critical avenue where
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2657,2662.0,we can challenge our energy.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2659,2667.0,"So for each of us, as we make these decisions, we"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2664,2670.0,need to consider what they are and what the effects are on the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2667,2675.0,"climate change in general. Thank you, John."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2672,2678.0,[Professor John Rowan] I was just noting there that the quality of the questions coming
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2675,2682.0,through in the chat are absolutely superb and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2679,2686.0,wide ranging. I'm very interested in
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2683,2690.0,picking up the issue of the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2687,2694.0,global nature of the challenge and particularly
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2691,2698.0,"the issue, there's a very nice question from Kevin who speaks"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2695,2702.0,to Sue's point about vital to educate
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2699,2706.0,"the young, and I think everybody acknowledges that that's a"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2703,2710.0,very valid thing to do. Then there's a question about
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2707,2714.0,other generations who may yet be less convinced of
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2711,2717.0,"the need for a response and then there's that idea about,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2714,2720.0,"well, what can I do? Maybe maybe there's nothing I can do as an"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2717,2724.0,"individual and maybe its even if I do something, the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2721,2728.0,"quote, very nice quote, it's everything we do is peanuts"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2725,2731.0,"compared to countries like China who are doing nothing, so why should"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2728,2734.0,we? So there is this kind of wider narrative
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2731,2738.0,about globalism and about agency at the local
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2735,2741.0,level or the individual level.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2738,2744.0,So I'm interested in coming across the panel
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2741,2748.0,"and maybe just turn to each of you in turn, to invite you to"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2745,2751.0,"just share your thoughts about how you, as"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2748,2755.0,"an individual, academic and professional,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2752,2759.0,are thinking about ways in which you may be
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2756,2762.0,changing your lifestyle or responding to the challenges that we have
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2759,2766.0,in an individual way and how you reconcile your own
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2763,2769.0,individual agency in the context of being part of the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2766,2773.0,"global community. So, not an easy question,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2770,2777.0,"I'm afraid, but let me start with you, Pete, about"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2774,2780.0,"things that you're doing in your life, your understanding"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2777,2784.0,"of your place in the world, and then the extent to which you feel"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2781,2787.0,that you can influence the future to meet the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2784,2790.0,targets that we are setting for ourselves.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2787,2792.0,Over to you I think.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2789,2795.0,[Professor Pete Fox] Thank you. There's something that everybody can
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2792,2799.0,do. Whether it's the choices people
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2796,2803.0,"make on what they buy and where they shop, the"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2800,2808.0,choices they have in how they spend their time and how they campaign.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2805,2812.0,I was in London during the

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2813,2820.0,October '19 and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2817,2823.0,the city was energised by such
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2820,2829.0,a broad coalition of people of all ages
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2826,2832.0,coming together to share their concerns about
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2829,2837.0,a whole wide range of of environmental
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2834,2840.0,and climate driven issues and camping
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2837,2844.0,in the streets in the city centre and really
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2841,2848.0,drawing people's attention to the need for action.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2845,2851.0,"That didn't cost people very much else, apart"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2848,2855.0,"from buying a tent and pitching it on Whitehall, and"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2852,2859.0,yet it absolutely drew the world's attention to the crisis
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2856,2864.0,that we're facing and so I think there is something for all of us
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2861,2868.0,"in this, because if we don't act, then we are complicit"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2865,2872.0,in watching what happens.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2869,2876.0,"In terms of my own actions, I"

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2900,2907.0,I can afford it. I think I've got the money to be able to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2904,2910.0,make that commitment as well and so those are kind

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,2932,2939.0,"So if people want to start there, there's no better place in my mind"

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3045,3051.0,thinking that would be really good to do that and

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3186,3192.0,educate that future generation of leaders who
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3189,3196.0,are going back to their country and will make a major difference and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3193,3199.0,that's something where I can make a difference.

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3230,3237.0,"It's probably not possible to completely do this online, people"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3234,3240.0,have to actually sit in the same room and there is a trade-off
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3237,3244.0,because you have to fly into Glasgow to do these things.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3241,3248.0,"But, you know, as it is something we have to probably"

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3296,3302.0,ahead if you do not do something very seriously at home.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3299,3306.0,So the fact the argument that Europe is a small

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3320,3327.0,So that's something we clearly should work on in our

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3326,3334.0,"[Professor John Rowan] Thank you very much Volker and I'm going to give a final, very speedy"

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3355,3361.0,"things like this, which is the toolkit, the Citizen Sensing"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3358,3365.0,"toolkit, which has all kinds of tools and methods and stories"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3362,3367.0,of success that people can take up.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3364,3370.0,On a professional level I aim to publish

EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3382,3388.0,got married a couple of years ago and I decided that I wasn't going
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3385,3390.0,to buy a new wedding dress.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3387,3393.0,I actually found a wedding dress in my village at the second hand
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3390,3397.0,shop and really strangely it was
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3394,3401.0,"from 50, no, 70 years ago, somebody who was exactly"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3398,3405.0,"the same size, same height, same frame as"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3402,3407.0,"me and it fitted me like a glove and so that was a story, a success"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3404,3411.0,story. It's something very personal that I could put out there and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3408,3415.0,I got something like 700 or 800 likes and comments
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3412,3418.0,on Twitter because of that. So I think it's spreading those small
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3415,3421.0,stories of success as well about things that we can do on a personal
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3418,3424.0,level that can really inspire people to take something up.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3421,3428.0,"Ok, thank you."
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3425,3432.0,[Professor John Rowan] Thank you. An incredibly moving and powerful story
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3429,3435.0,"there. I think it's very, very symbolic of that"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3432,3439.0,whole wider piece around the circular economy and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3436,3443.0,reusing and remaking and finding that that's
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3440,3446.0,actually just an incredibly important thing to do and enjoy
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3443,3450.0,and adds to your sense of occasion that you managed to
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3447,3452.0,do that. So thanks for sharing that Mel.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3449,3456.0,"So I'm afraid that we are at the end of our time,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3453,3459.0,audience. There's been some fantastic questions that
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3456,3463.0,"have come through. It's not been possible, I'm afraid, to turn"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3460,3466.0,to each of them in turn. We've had a rather wide ranging and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3463,3471.0,unmoveable conversation but I think that's in the nature of
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3468,3474.0,the spontaneity of our discussions together.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3471,3478.0,"What we will do is, I think, try and capture the questions"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3475,3482.0,that we've got in some sort of small summary of tonight's
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3479,3485.0,events and we'll put that on the University web pages
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3482,3489.0,and share it as a
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3486,3492.0,record of tonight's events and hopefully address some of the
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3489,3495.0,questions that we didn't have a chance to get round to.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3492,3498.0,"I hope, as the audience would agree, that we've had some excellent"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3495,3502.0,talks. I'm really impressed by the the questions and the cut and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3499,3505.0,thrust and I know that we saw really nice
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3502,3509.0,"examples of questions bouncing off each other, and again,"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3506,3513.0,I hope you think that we've got to as many of those as we could.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3510,3516.0,"I don't think we necessarily have all the answers, but I think we've"
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3513,3519.0,really got a sense of a community pulling together and
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3516,3523.0,in the same direction. So I would like to just close by inviting
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3520,3527.0,you to join me by thanking your speakers for the talks
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3524,3530.0,and their impressive responses to your questions.
EGtGQhJYA8w,Saturday Series 2021- The Climate Emergency - local responses to a global menace,3527,3533.0,"I'd like to thank you all for your questions, both those that were"

IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,4,12.0,"The dominant vision in the field right now is, collect a lot of data, run a lot of statistics,"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,9,13.0,and intelligence will emerge.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,10,15.0,And I think that's wrong.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,12,19.0,"I think that having a lot of data is important, and collecting a lot of statistics is important."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,16,23.0,"But I think what we also need is deep understanding, not just so-called ""deep learning."""
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,20,29.0,"So deep learning finds what's typically correlated, but we all know that correlation is not the"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,26,31.0,same thing as causation.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,28,34.0,"And even though we all know that and everybody learned that in Intro to Psych, or should"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,31,38.0,have learned that in Intro to Psych they should have learned that you don't know whether cigarettes
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,35,40.0,cause smoking just from the statistics we have.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,37,44.0,We have to make causal inferences and do careful studies.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,41,48.0,We all know that causation and correlation are not the same thing.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,45,51.0,Have right now as AIs-- giant correlation machines.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,48,56.0,"And it works, if you have enough control of the data relative to the problem that you're"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,53,59.0,"studying that you can exhaust the problem, to beat the problem into submission."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,56,61.0,So you can do that with go.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,58,65.0,"You could play this game, over and over again, the rules never change."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,62,67.0,"They haven't changed in 2,000 years."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,64,69.0,And the board is always the same size.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,66,73.0,"And so you can just get enough statistics about what tends to work, and you're good"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,70,74.0,to go.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,71,79.0,"But if you want to use the same techniques for natural language understanding, for example,"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,76,82.0,"or to guide a domestic robot through your house, it's not going to work."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,79,86.0,So the domestic robot in your house is going to keep seeing new situations.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,83,90.0,"And your natural language understanding system, every dialogue is going to be different."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,87,91.0,It's not really going to work.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,88,96.0,"So yeah, you can talk to Alexa and you can say, please turn on my over and over again,"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,93,97.0,get statistics on that.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,94,98.0,It's fine.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,95,102.0,But there's no machine in the world T=that we're having right now.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,99,106.0,It's just not anywhere near a reality and you're not going to be able to do it with
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,103,109.0,"the statistics, because there's not enough similar stuff going on."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,106,112.0,Probably the single best thing that we could do to make our machines smarter is to give
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,109,115.0,"them common sense, which is much harder than it sounds like."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,112,119.0,"I mean, first you might say, what is common sense?"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,116,122.0,And what we settled on in the book that we wrote is that common sense is the knowledge
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,119,124.0,that's commonly held.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,121,125.0,that ordinary people have.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,122,127.0,And yet machines don't.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,124,131.0,"So machines are really good at things like, I don't know, converting metrics -- you know,"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,128,134.0,converting from the English system to the metric system.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,131,137.0,"Things that are nice, and precise, and factual, and easily stated."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,134,142.0,"But things that are a little bit less sharply stated, like how you open a door, machines"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,139,145.0,don't understand the first thing.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,142,149.0,So there's actually a competition right now for opening doors.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,146,153.0,"So if somebody uploaded data sets from 500 different doors, and they're hoping that robots"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,150,157.0,will experiment with all 500 doors and then get it.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,154,160.0,But what's more likely is that they'll get to door 501 and they'll actually have a problem
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,157,162.0,or at least door 601.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,159,168.0,"So every ordinary person in the west has opened a bunch of door knobs and gets the idea, right?"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,165,174.0,"I need to turn something, jiggle something -- might be different for the next one -- until"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,171,175.0,the door itself is free.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,172,177.0,So you can give a definition of something like that.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,174,179.0,It's hard to give a perfect definition.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,176,180.0,But we all know that.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,177,183.0,And yet nobody's ever built a robot that can do that.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,180,185.0,We made a joke about it in the book.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,182,190.0,"We said, you know, in the event of a robot attack do the following six things and number"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,187,193.0,one was close the door.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,190,196.0,And we added that you might need to lock it.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,193,198.0,And that was before this whole database came out.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,195,200.0,"So, you know, the field advances."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,197,202.0,People are working on that.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,199,204.0,Maybe next year they'll work on teaching robots about locks.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,201,208.0,But I bet you it will take a while before robots understand all the little ways it can
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,205,212.0,"jiggle the key, and maybe you need to pull in the door to make it just right."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,209,217.0,We don't know how to even encode that information in a language that a computer can understand.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,214,221.0,"So the big challenge of common sense is to take stuff like that-- like, how do you open"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,218,226.0,"the door, why do you want to open a door-- and translate into the language of the machine."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,223,228.0,It's a lot harder than a metric converter.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,225,231.0,It's a lot harder than a database.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,228,235.0,And right now the field's not even really trying to answer that question.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,232,239.0,"It's so obsessed with what it can do with these big databases, which are exciting in"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,236,243.0,"themselves, that it's kind of lost sight of that, even though the question itself that"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,240,248.0,"goes back to the 1950s, when one of the founders of A.I., John McCarthy, first started writing"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,245,249.0,about it in the late '50s.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,246,252.0,But it's not-- common sense is not getting the attention that it deserves and that's
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,249,254.0,one of the reasons we wrote the book.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,251,258.0,Common sense is just one step along the way to intelligence.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,255,260.0,People talk about artificial intelligence.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,257,262.0,And sometimes they talk about artificial general intelligence.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,259,264.0,There's also narrow AI.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,261,267.0,And narrow AI is the stuff that we're doing pretty well now.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,264,271.0,"So, do the same problem over and over again, just solving one problem."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,268,274.0,You could think about idiot Savants that can do a calendar but can't do anything else and
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,271,279.0,can tell you what day you were born on if you give them your birthday.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,276,280.0,We have a lot of narrow AI right now.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,277,283.0,We can't do narrow AI for everything that we want to do.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,280,288.0,"But the dream is to have broad AI, or general AI, that can solve any problem."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,285,289.0,You think about the Star Trek computer.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,286,295.0,"You can say, you know, please give me the demographics in this galaxy and cross-correlate"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,292,297.0,"it with this, and with that, and tell me this."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,294,298.0,"And Star Trek computer says, OK."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,295,300.0,And it figures it out.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,297,304.0,"So the Star Trek computer understands everything about language, and it understands pretty"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,301,306.0,much everything about how the world works.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,303,308.0,And it can put those together to give you an answer.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,305,309.0,"It's not like Google, right?"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,306,312.0,Google can search for pages that have the information.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,309,314.0,But then you have to put the information together.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,311,316.0,The Star Trek computer can synthesize it.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,313,319.0,And it's a great example if you don't have common sense.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,316,323.0,"If I ask you, did George Washington have a cell phone?"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,320,328.0,"Well, if you have a kind of common knowledge of when cellphones were introduced, when George"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,325,332.0,"Washington was alive, the fact that he's dead, then you could compute the information and"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,329,333.0,give me the right answer.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,330,336.0,"If you Google for it, you might get a wacky answer."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,333,340.0,"If it works for George Washington, maybe you search for, did Thomas Jefferson have a cell"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,337,341.0,phone?
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,338,342.0,And the answer should obviously be the same.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,339,344.0,But maybe that one won't be on a Google page.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,341,351.0,"So if you have common sense about things like time, and space, and a lot of sort of everyday"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,348,354.0,"factual knowledge, that gets you a long way to intelligence."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,351,356.0,It doesn't give you all the way there.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,353,359.0,"So general intelligence, first of all, has many dimensions to it."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,356,363.0,"So you can think like, the SAT has verbal and math."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,360,370.0,Those are two of the Of intelligence that's Really not well-established right now in the
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,367,372.0,AI community is common sense.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,369,378.0,"There are other aspects of intelligence, like doing pure calculation, As well."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,375,387.0,"For example, the ability to read a graph is partly about common sense, and it's partly"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,384,392.0,"about understanding what people might intend, it's partly sometimes about expert knowledge."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,389,395.0,So reading a graph is another form of intelligence.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,392,398.0,"And that's going to require putting together better perceptual tools than we have now,"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,395,404.0,"better common sense tools, probably some knowledge about politics, for example, if you're reading"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,401,406.0,"a graph that's relevant to the latest political campaign, and so forth."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,403,412.0,So there's a lot of stuff Right now we're trying to approximate it all with statistics.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,409,413.0,But it's never general knowledge.
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,410,419.0,"So you could learn to read one graph, Going help you read the next graph."
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,416,423.0,"So general intelligence is going to be putting together a lot of things, both some that we"
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,420,427.0,already understand pretty well in the A.I. community and some we just haven't been working
IHE63fxpHCg,The biggest problem in AI? Machines have no common sense. | Gary Marcus | Big Think,424,,on and really need to get back to.

OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",46,53.0,But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",50,57.0,"18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",54,59.0,"as a sort of a play project,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",56,61.0,kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",58,64.0,And so he gave me the time to code it up.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",61,69.0,So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",66,72.0,"hypertext protocol, HTTP;"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",69,75.0,"the idea of URLs, these names for things"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",72,77.0,which started with HTTP.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",74,79.0,I wrote the code and put it out there.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",76,81.0,Why did I do it?
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",78,83.0,"Well, it was basically frustration."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",80,87.0,I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",84,89.0,"in this huge, very exciting lab,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",86,91.0,lots of people coming from all over the world.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",88,94.0,They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",91,97.0,"They had all sorts of different data formats,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",94,99.0,"all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",96,102.0,"So that, in all that diversity,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",99,104.0,if I wanted to figure out how to build something
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",101,106.0,"out of a bit of this and a bit of this,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",103,110.0,"everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",107,112.0,"I had to learn to run some new program,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",109,117.0,I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",114,119.0,And these were all incompatible.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",116,121.0,It was just very frustrating.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",118,123.0,The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",120,126.0,"In fact, on all these discs there were documents."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",123,129.0,So if you just imagined them all
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",126,134.0,"being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",131,136.0,"say on the Internet,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",133,138.0,then life would be so much easier.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",135,142.0,"Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",139,144.0,and even if people don't read your memo --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",141,147.0,"actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",144,150.0,"He had written, ""Vague, but exciting,"" in pencil, in the corner."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",147,152.0,(Laughter)
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",149,156.0,But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",153,158.0,what the web was like.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",155,160.0,It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",157,163.0,"But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",160,166.0,"so things like ""click"" didn't have the same meaning."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",163,168.0,"I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",165,170.0,"a page which has got links,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",167,174.0,and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",171,176.0,Not impressive.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",173,179.0,"You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",176,182.0,What was difficult was to get them to imagine:
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",179,186.0,"so, imagine that that link could have gone"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",183,189.0,to virtually any document you could imagine.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",186,193.0,"Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",190,195.0,"Well, some people did."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",192,199.0,"So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",196,203.0,And that is what has made it most fun.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",200,205.0,"That has been the most exciting thing,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",202,207.0,"not the technology, not the things people have done with it,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",204,209.0,"but actually the community, the spirit of all these people"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",206,211.0,"getting together, sending the emails."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",208,213.0,That's what it was like then.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",210,216.0,"Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",213,218.0,"I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",215,221.0,"I said, ""Could you put your documents on this web thing?"""
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",218,224.0,And you did.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",221,225.0,Thanks.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",222,227.0,"It's been a blast, hasn't it?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",224,229.0,"I mean, it has been quite interesting"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",226,231.0,because we've found out that the things that happen with the web
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",228,233.0,really sort of blow us away.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",230,235.0,They're much more than we'd originally imagined
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",232,237.0,"when we put together the little, initial website"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",234,239.0,that we started off with.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",236,242.0,"Now, I want you to put your data on the web."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",239,246.0,Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",243,248.0,There is still a huge frustration
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",245,252.0,that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",249,254.0,"What do you mean, ""data""? What's the difference -- documents, data?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",251,257.0,"Well, documents you read, OK?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",254,260.0,"More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",257,262.0,Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",259,268.0,Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",265,272.0,One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",269,274.0,one of the great TED Talks.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",271,276.0,Hans put up this presentation
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",273,281.0,"in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",278,284.0,he showed income levels on one axis
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",281,287.0,"and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",284,291.0,"So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",288,294.0,which just shattered a lot of myths that people had
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",291,298.0,about the economics in the developing world.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",295,300.0,He put up a slide a little bit like this.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",297,302.0,It had underground all the data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",299,305.0,"OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",302,307.0,"and that's how we think of it, isn't it?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",304,310.0,Because data you can't naturally use by itself
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",307,314.0,"But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",311,317.0,and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",314,319.0,"In this case, Hans had put the data together"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",316,324.0,he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",321,326.0,"He had put it together,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",323,329.0,combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",326,334.0,"and then he'd put it into this software,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",331,336.0,"which I think his son developed, originally,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",333,339.0,and produces this wonderful presentation.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",336,341.0,And Hans made a point
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",338,345.0,"of saying, ""Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."""
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",342,348.0,And I was happy to see that at the party last night
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",345,352.0,"that he was still saying, very forcibly, ""It's really important to have a lot of data."""
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",349,354.0,So I want us now to think about
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",351,358.0,"not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",355,363.0,but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",360,365.0,and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",362,367.0,and then calling that linked data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",364,369.0,"The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",366,373.0,If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",370,376.0,first thing is that those HTTP names --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",373,378.0,"those things that start with ""http:"" --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",375,382.0,"we're using them not just for documents now,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",379,384.0,we're using them for things that the documents are about.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",381,386.0,"We're using them for people, we're using them for places,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",383,390.0,"we're using them for your products, we're using them for events."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",387,394.0,"All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",391,399.0,"Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",396,401.0,and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",398,403.0,"using the HTTP protocol from the web,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",400,406.0,I will get back some data in a standard format
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",403,411.0,which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",408,413.0,"about that thing, about that event."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",410,415.0,"Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",412,417.0,"where they were born, things like that."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",414,419.0,So the second rule is I get important information back.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",416,423.0,Third rule is that when I get back that information
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",420,426.0,"it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",423,428.0,it's got relationships.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",425,430.0,Data is relationships.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",427,432.0,"Interestingly, data is relationships."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",429,436.0,This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",433,439.0,"And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",436,442.0,then the other thing that it's related to
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",439,446.0,is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",443,448.0,"So, I can go ahead and look that thing up."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",445,451.0,So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",448,454.0,"I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",451,457.0,"and the population of it, and so on."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",454,459.0,So I can browse this stuff.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",456,461.0,"So that's it, really."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",458,463.0,That is linked data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",460,466.0,"I wrote an article entitled ""Linked Data"" a couple of years ago"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",463,470.0,"and soon after that, things started to happen."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",467,474.0,The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",471,476.0,"of these boxes that Hans had,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",473,478.0,and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",475,481.0,It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",478,483.0,"It's not just a root supplying a plant,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",480,486.0,"but for each of those plants, whatever it is --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",483,489.0,"a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",486,492.0,they get to look at all the data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",489,494.0,"and they get it connected together,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",491,496.0,and the really important thing about data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",493,498.0,"is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",495,500.0,"So, linked data."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",497,502.0,The meme went out there.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",499,506.0,"And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",503,508.0,"who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",505,510.0,he noticed that Wikipedia --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",507,513.0,"you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",510,515.0,with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",512,519.0,"Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",516,522.0,"And in most information boxes, there's data."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",519,526.0,"So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",523,528.0,and put it into a blob of linked data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",525,531.0,"on the web, which he called dbpedia."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",528,535.0,Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",532,537.0,"and if you actually go and look up Berlin,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",534,539.0,you'll find that there are other blobs of data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",536,542.0,"which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",539,545.0,"So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",542,547.0,you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",544,550.0,And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",547,552.0,"This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",549,555.0,Let's think about data for a bit.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",552,558.0,Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",555,561.0,Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",558,564.0,that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",561,567.0,So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",564,571.0,"We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",568,574.0,"there's scientific data, there's personal data,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",571,576.0,"there's weather data, there's data about events,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",573,580.0,"there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",577,583.0,I'm just going to mention a few of them
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",580,585.0,"so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",582,589.0,so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",586,591.0,Let's start with government data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",588,593.0,"Barack Obama said in a speech,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",590,598.0,that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",595,600.0,in accessible formats.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",597,602.0,And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",599,604.0,That's important. Why is it important?
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",601,607.0,"Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",604,610.0,but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",607,615.0,Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",612,617.0,It's actual useful. It's got value.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",614,619.0,I can use it in my company.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",616,621.0,I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",618,624.0,"So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",621,626.0,by making this data available.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",623,630.0,In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",627,632.0,"in a government department, often you find that"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",629,635.0,"these people, they're very tempted to keep it --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",632,638.0,Hans calls it database hugging.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",635,640.0,"You hug your database, you don't want to let it go"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",637,642.0,until you've made a beautiful website for it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",639,644.0,"Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",641,646.0,"yes, make a beautiful website,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",643,648.0,who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",645,651.0,"Make a beautiful website, but first"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",648,654.0,"give us the unadulterated data,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",651,656.0,we want the data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",653,658.0,We want unadulterated data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",655,661.0,"OK, we have to ask for raw data now."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",658,663.0,"And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",660,664.0,"Can you say ""raw""?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",661,665.0,Audience: Raw.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",662,666.0,"Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say ""data""?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",663,667.0,Audience: Data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",664,668.0,"TBL: Can you say ""now""?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",665,669.0,Audience: Now!
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",666,671.0,"TBL: Alright, ""raw data now""!"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",668,673.0,Audience: Raw data now!
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",670,677.0,Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",674,679.0,people come up with to hang onto their data
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",676,683.0,"and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",680,685.0,And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",682,688.0,"And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",685,691.0,So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",688,696.0,"Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",693,701.0,of the huge challenges that human society has right now --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",698,704.0,"curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",701,707.0,"understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",704,709.0,understanding how the world works.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",706,711.0,The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",708,713.0,"they have half-formed ideas in their head,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",710,716.0,they try to communicate those over the web.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",713,719.0,But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",716,722.0,"is on databases, often sitting in their computers,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",719,725.0,"and actually, currently not shared."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",722,728.0,"In fact, I'll just go into one area --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",725,730.0,"if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",727,733.0,drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",730,735.0,because scientists in that field realize
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",732,738.0,"this is a great way of getting out of those silos,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",735,742.0,because they had their genomics data in one database
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",739,745.0,"in one building, and they had their protein data in another."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",742,748.0,"Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",745,751.0,"and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",748,753.0,I wouldn't ask -- they would.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",750,755.0,What proteins are involved in signal transduction
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",752,757.0,and also related to pyramidal neurons?
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",754,760.0,"Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",757,763.0,"Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",760,765.0,because nobody has asked that question before.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",762,767.0,"You get 223,000 hits --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",764,769.0,no results you can use.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",766,772.0,You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",769,776.0,"32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",773,778.0,and you can look at.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",775,781.0,"The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",778,783.0,questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",780,786.0,is really a complete sea change.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",783,788.0,It's very very important.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",785,790.0,Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",787,795.0,the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",792,798.0,and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",795,802.0,"Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",799,805.0,and has nothing to do with you.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",802,807.0,"But, that's not true."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",804,809.0,"In fact, data is about our lives."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",806,812.0,"You just -- you log on to your social networking site,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",809,814.0,"your favorite one, you say, ""This is my friend."""
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",811,817.0,Bing! Relationship. Data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",814,820.0,"You say, ""This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. """
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",817,823.0,"Bing! That's data. Data, data, data."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",820,825.0,"Every time you do things on the social networking site,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",822,829.0,the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",826,833.0,and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",830,835.0,"But, when you go to another linked data site --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",832,838.0,"and let's say this is one about travel,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",835,841.0,"and you say, ""I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"""
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",838,843.0,you can't get over the walls.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",840,845.0,"The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",842,846.0,tremendous frustration.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",843,848.0,The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",845,850.0,between social networking sites.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",847,852.0,We need to do that with linked data.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",849,855.0,"One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",852,858.0,"Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",855,860.0,"The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",857,863.0,Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",860,865.0,The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",862,867.0,"So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",864,872.0,"I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",869,875.0,"And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",872,878.0,"and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",875,880.0,I did that. Me!
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",877,882.0,I did that to the map. I just did that!
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",879,884.0,"I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",881,887.0,If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",884,890.0,and it creates an incredible resource
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",887,893.0,because everybody else does theirs.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",890,896.0,And that is what linked data is all about.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",893,899.0,It's about people doing their bit
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",896,902.0,"to produce a little bit, and it all connecting."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",899,905.0,That's how linked data works.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",902,909.0,You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",906,913.0,You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",910,916.0,but you know to demand it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",913,918.0,And we've practiced that.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",915,922.0,"So, linked data -- it's huge."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",919,925.0,I've only told you a very small number of things
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",922,927.0,"There are data in every aspect of our lives,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",924,930.0,"every aspect of work and pleasure,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",927,933.0,"and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",930,936.0,it's about connecting it together.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",933,939.0,"And when you connect data together, you get power"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",936,942.0,"in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",939,946.0,You get this really huge power out of it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",943,949.0,"So, we're at the stage now"
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",946,953.0,where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",950,956.0,And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",953,958.0,even though there's not an immediate return on the investment
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",955,961.0,because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",958,965.0,they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",962,968.0,which would be good if everybody else did them.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",965,970.0,"OK, so it's called linked data."
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",967,972.0,I want you to make it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",969,974.0,I want you to demand it.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",971,976.0,And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
OM6XIICm_qo,"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data",973,977.0,Thanks.

Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,2,7.0,but should you make changes incrementally
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,4,10.0,or go for a complete overhaul?
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,7,12.0,"Whenever you begin a redesign,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,9,15.0,"make sure it's based on real user data,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,12,18.0,and the project has clear goals and success measures.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,15,21.0,Sometimes massive redesigns are launched
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,18,23.0,because organizations are bored with their design
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,20,25.0,and they think it's outdated.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,22,28.0,"Instead, we should make sure that there's clear evidence"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,25,32.0,that a redesign will help users better achieve their goals.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,29,35.0,"And in a lot of cases, this means focusing"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,32,38.0,on improving those less glamorous aspects of design
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,35,42.0,"like our content, structure, and interaction design,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,39,45.0,because those can greatly help users reach their goals.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,42,49.0,"All of that said, in most cases, incremental changes"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,46,52.0,are better than complete product overhauls.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,49,54.0,"We know users hate change,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,51,56.0,so overhauls can be jarring for users.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,53,59.0,Incremental change brings less risk
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,56,61.0,but still has measurable impact.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,58,64.0,Huge overhauls are also pretty expensive
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,61,68.0,and require a large investment in time and resources.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,65,71.0,Making targeted adjustments and improving over time
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,68,74.0,is usually more beneficial to users
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,71,76.0,and to business resources.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,73,78.0,Though there are some specific cases
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,75,79.0,"where large overhauls are best,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,76,82.0,so let me highlight three of those cases.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,79,85.0,"If you've been trying incremental changes for a few years,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,82,87.0,but find there's not much else you can do
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,84,89.0,"to improve your product,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,86,92.0,it's probably time for a radical change.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,89,95.0,If your backend systems can't support key user interactions
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,92,98.0,"and your tech is severely outdated,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,95,100.0,you'll need a radical redesign.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,97,103.0,Or if benchmarking data shows that your competitors
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,100,105.0,"are far more superior,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,102,107.0,"and you're losing customers because of it,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,104,109.0,you'll need a radical overhaul.
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,106,111.0,You're probably familiar with the saying
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,108,114.0,"when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,111,116.0,"As a designer, of course you have the tools"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,113,118.0,"to radically redesign your system,"
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,115,121.0,but you should use your knowledge of user needs
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,118,124.0,and business goals to determine which redesign strategy
Ar_MEwsu150,Product Redesigns: Incremental or Overhaul,121,,is best for your context.

87AEeLpodnE,A conservative's plea: Let's work together | Arthur Brooks,667,673.0,"Because when we talk in this country about economics,"

a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,-1,6.0,"So let's talk about saying no. It's a pretty simple concept; in fact, it's"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,3,10.0,one of the first words that we usually learn as kids. And so you might figure that kids use the
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,7,14.0,"power of ""no"" to fix their mistakes and learn how language really works."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,11,19.0,"But it turns out, kids accentuate the positive when it comes to honing their linguistic skills."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,16,37.0,"There's no room for negative thinking. I'm Moti Lieberman, and this is the Ling Space."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,34,41.0,"From the moment they pop into the world, and even before then, kids get exposed to"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,38,46.0,"language. They hear full sound systems, they have complete, beautiful sentences lobbed"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,43,50.0,"at them, and there are just words everywhere. And all of this data, for whatever language"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,47,54.0,"that they're learning, is positive evidence of how that language works."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,51,57.0,"For example, when they hear an English word like ""apples,"" it's telling them lots"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,54,62.0,"of things - like, you can have syllables that don't start with consonants, but you can also have"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,59,63.0,ones that end with them.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,60,68.0,"Or look at a sentence: a question like ""Which airplane did Emily fly?"" tells you that"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,65,72.0,"to make a question in English, you need to move the question word to the beginning of the sentence,"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,69,77.0,"as well as the tense marker, did. Every piece of data that a kid hears is just one"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,74,82.0,more little push towards working out all the different parameters of their future linguistic playground.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,79,86.0,"So all of that positive proof, all the data that kids gather from around them, forms the backbone"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,83,90.0,"of their linguistic knowledge. They hear something, they know that it works"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,87,93.0,"in their language, and they use this information to form their hypotheses about how"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,90,97.0,everything comes together. But there's another obvious kind of information that kids could
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,94,102.0,"be using to solve linguistic mysteries, and that's being told they're doing things wrong."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,99,106.0,"Getting corrected, and being given the right response, seems like an easy path to greater"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,103,111.0,"linguistic glory. After all, adult speakers of your language are telling you to do this"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,108,115.0,thing! Not that other terrible faulty thing! What could possibly go wrong?
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,112,120.0,"Well… turns out, a whoooole lot. First, we're actually kind of bad at telling kids"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,117,126.0,when they've gotten things wrong. Think about this actual attested exchange between a parent and child:
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,123,129.0,"""Me want more!"" ""You want more? More what?"""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,126,132.0,"""Want more milk!"" ""You want more milk?"""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,129,135.0,"""More milk!"" ""Sure, I'll get that for you."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,132,139.0,So we can agree this is a successful communication - the kid gets their point
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,136,144.0,"across, and can triumphantly drink some milk. But is this a successful language lesson?"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,141,148.0,"The parent may be providing good examples of English, but there's no direct correction"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,145,153.0,of anything that the child is saying. So there's no way for the kid to know that they were
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,150,157.0,"wrong. And yet, if the parent did stop to correct them like this, we probably wouldn't"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,154,160.0,"be like, wow, good child-rearing skills, dude:"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,157,164.0,"""Me want more!"" ""That's not grammatical English."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,161,168.0,"""Want more milk!"" ""Still not grammatical English."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,165,172.0,"""More milk!"" ""Also not grammatical English."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,169,177.0,"""WAAAAH!"" ""Try ""I want more milk, please."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,174,182.0,"So we prize good, accurate communication over correcting children's linguistic mistakes straight-up."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,179,187.0,"We'll often accept grammatical errors, as long as the sentences they're in are true."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,184,190.0,This is the point of a classic study by Brown and Hanlon.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,187,195.0,"So take a look at this exchange. The child says, ""Mama isn't a boy, he's a girl!"""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,192,200.0,"Now, this is clearly wrong - the pronoun ""he"" doesn't match girl. It should be ""she"","
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,197,204.0,"instead. But there's no correction: the mother just responds, ""That's right."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,201,207.0,"The information was correct, and that's what mattered."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,204,211.0,"And we see the opposite happening in this study, as well, where the sentence was grammatically"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,208,216.0,"correct, but the parent rejected it. Take a sentence where a child looking at a lighthouse says,"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,213,220.0,"""That's the animal farmhouse."" Now, that's a grammatical sentence, but it isn't"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,217,225.0,"a very good description of a lighthouse. And sure enough, the mother says, ""No, that's"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,222,229.0,"a lighthouse."" And there's no congratulations for getting out a grammatical sentence. There's"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,226,232.0,just a sweeping away of the incorrect meaning.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,229,236.0,"These aren't isolated examples, either. Brown and Hanlon found that parents were able"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,233,240.0,to understand roughly the same number of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences produced
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,237,244.0,"by children in the study, roughly 45% of each type."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,241,248.0,"And when the parent explicitly said that something was good or bad, it had nothing"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,245,252.0,to do with whether the grammar was good or not. It was due to either the meaning
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,249,254.0,or the pronunciation not being up to standards.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,251,258.0,"To quote the paper, the study found ""not even a shred of evidence that approval and"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,255,264.0,"disapproval are contingent on syntactic correctness"". And when that kind of categorical language is showing"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,261,270.0,"up in academic papers, you know that the researchers are really, really sure. And this result has"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,267,275.0,"been proven a whole bunch of times since then, in a lot of different research papers. But if you think"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,272,279.0,"back to our first exchange, about the milk, you might notice something."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,276,283.0,"Whenever the kid is saying something that's a syntactic mistake, the parent is correcting"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,280,287.0,"them with a good, grammatical sentence. And it turns out, this kind of repetition"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,284,291.0,is more common with grammatically incorrect sentences than with good ones.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,288,296.0,So maybe recasting the sentences into a correct form is the way to get the point across about
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,293,301.0,grammatical wrongness. Except this turns out not really to work either. Just because it's
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,298,304.0,more common for ungrammatical sentences doesn't mean that it happens all of the time.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,301,309.0,"In fact, it doesn't happen anywhere near all of the time. It doesn't even happen regularly!"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,306,315.0,73% of child utterances that are constructed wrong one way or another don't get corrected.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,312,320.0,"And almost 14% of sentences that are totally beautiful get repeated, too."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,317,325.0,So these kinds of corrections are just noisy feedback - if kids really relied on adult speakers
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,322,329.0,"to show them the route to linguistic mastery this way, they'd just end up making a different"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,326,333.0,set of mistakes than the ones they started out with. They wouldn't work out the language. So
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,330,334.0,this isn't enough.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,331,338.0,"But here's the thing - even when adults do reach out to kids and tell them ""no, you're"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,335,343.0,"doing it wrong, do it like this"", kids often don't listen. Take a look at my favourite"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,340,349.0,"exchange in all of linguistics, first reported in 1966. Here, a mom is trying to get her"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,346,352.0,kid to say this unfortunate sentence correctly:
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,349,357.0,"""Nobody don't like me."" ""No, say 'Nobody likes me.'"""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,354,360.0,"""Nobody don't like me."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,357,363.0,"And this happens eight times! Until finally, it ends with..."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,360,368.0,"""Now listen carefully, say 'Nobody likes me.'"""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,365,372.0,"""Oh! Nobody don't likes me."""
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,369,376.0,So this mom has decided to really carefully try to get her kid to say this English
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,373,382.0,"sentence correctly, with only one negation and with a third-person singular -s. But the child totally"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,379,387.0,"resists this correction for a long time, and even when they do it, they still don't get it to"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,384,391.0,come out like it should. Why is that? What's making this kid so stubborn? The
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,388,396.0,"problem is that when a child is making these mistakes, they don't see them as mistakes."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,393,400.0,"To a child, this is the their best guess of how English works right now."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,397,404.0,"They're outputted from the kid's grammar, which is built from all the English"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,401,406.0,sentences they've heard over the time they've been alive.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,403,411.0,"The grammar in their head is a work in progress, as far as adult English goes, but it's internally"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,408,416.0,consistent for them at the time! And an adult giving them an extra example
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,413,420.0,or two isn't enough for them to override the conclusions that they've come to so far.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,417,424.0,"They know how their language works, thank you very much. And they don't take this"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,421,428.0,kind of feedback well. They're not rebelling; they're just sticking to their guns.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,425,433.0,"So that's the deal with direct negative evidence. However you look at it, corrections"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,430,437.0,"of whatever type are too irregular to be helpful, and even when it happens, kids just ignore it."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,434,442.0,"This kind of negative evidence is a total bust for helping kids learn language.But then,"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,439,447.0,"how do kids work it out? Well, getting more positive data about how the language works"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,444,451.0,"is a big strategy. The more data that you have for your language, the"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,448,456.0,"more examples you have to compare your rules to, and the more that you can refine your hypotheses,"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,453,459.0,until your system works pretty much the same as the rest of the people around you.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,456,463.0,"But the bottom line is, telling kids how to do language, much like telling kids how"
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,460,467.0,"to do anything they're set on doing their own way, isn't really likely to be successful."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,464,471.0,"We here at the Ling Space say, just say no to negative evidence."
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,468,474.0,So we've reached the end of the Ling Space for this week.
a7Un06tDOn0,Is Correcting Your Kid's Language Helpful? Negative Evidence,471,478.0,"If you were accepting our positive evidence, you learned that kids mostly use word and"

wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",102,106.0,You couldn't look something up on the web.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",103,109.0,This was a time when rediscovering the body meant
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",106,112.0,an investigation of the body from scratch.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",109,115.0,With very little knowledge left from antiquity.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",112,118.0,- And the understanding of the body in the ancient world
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",115,120.0,"like Contrapposto, is just being rediscovered"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",117,121.0,in this century.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",118,124.0,And look at the way in which the S curve of the body
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",121,125.0,is accentuated here.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",122,126.0,You can really see an artist who is
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",123,128.0,studying ancient sculpture.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",125,132.0,"In fact, one could probably argue that the arrows themselves"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",129,134.0,"almost function as diagramming lines,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",131,137.0,that help us see the shifting axis of the body.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",134,139.0,But there are also funny anachronisms here.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",136,142.0,Things are disjointed in terms of time.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",139,144.0,Since Sebastian is being martyred by
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",141,145.0,"an Ancient Roman Emperor,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",142,148.0,at a time when Ancient Rome is at the height of its power.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",145,150.0,"And yet, what the artist is showing us here is"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",147,153.0,Ancient Roman Architecture in ruins.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",150,155.0,The way it looked in Mantegna's own time.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",152,158.0,- And he's clearly relishing the beauty of those ruins
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",155,160.0,as ruins.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",157,162.0,- It's as if the faith of Christianity
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",159,164.0,has outlived the mighty Roman Empire.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",161,166.0,"- Right, which lays in ruins"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",163,168.0,around the feet of the Saint.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",165,170.0,- Here's an artist who is in part responsible
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",167,172.0,"for creating the art that we know of,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",169,173.0,as the Early Renaissance.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",170,175.0,"And characteristic of that moment,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",172,177.0,we see someone who is giving us as much
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",174,179.0,visual information as possible.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",176,181.0,Look at the precision
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",178,183.0,even in the buildings of extreme distance.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",180,185.0,That beautiful atmospheric perspective.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",182,188.0,"That careful delineation of form, of mass."
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",185,190.0,"- Right, modelling so we've got a sense"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",187,192.0,"of the three-dimensionality of the body,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",189,194.0,of the light coming from the left.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",191,197.0,We can see Mantegna's use of linear perspective
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",194,199.0,in the tiles on the floor.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",196,203.0,In a way this has everything we expect of the Renaissance.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",200,206.0,- This is bringing together those fragments from antiquity
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",203,207.0,that were just being rediscovered.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",204,210.0,This is trying to place these figures in a world
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",207,212.0,that we can occupy.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",209,214.0,- And a vast landscape.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",211,215.0,Pehaps we see the archers
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",212,218.0,"retreating on a road in the background,"
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",215,220.0,and a whole city that looks very much like
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",217,222.0,an Ancient Roman city.
wIbpSJdSz90,"Mantegna, Saint Sebastian",219,223.0,- Here's an artist that is central

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,177,183.0,We bolted them all together and hung them from the ceilings.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,180,184.0,Marshall: Wow.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,181,185.0,Stan: We got 22 of them.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,184,189.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,186,192.0,"Alright, so Marshall, today's episode we're gonna talk about adopting your art parents..."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,189,193.0,Marshall: Adopting your art parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,190,195.0,Stan: Which is pretty much like finding your art style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,192,197.0,Marshall: It is a lot like that.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,194,202.0,Stan: Yeah. You mentioned it in the first episode and people were asking for us to talk about that.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,199,205.0,Marshall: Let me talk about this class that I've been teaching with Vance Kovacs; this
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,202,213.0,"has been - the first meeting was to say, look who do I want - what kind of work do I want to do?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,210,215.0,What kind of style do I want to work in?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,212,223.0,And then choose those stylistic masters and then we put them up and talk about how sometimes
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,220,230.0,"our choices of parents might be based on superficial things; I love how this dad dresses, I love"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,227,236.0,"how this mom wears her hair, but they may not be the best parents."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,233,240.0,"And this is one of the first things that we see a lot is whatever is hot right now, whoever"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,237,245.0,"is happening right now, whoever's got the most pizzazzy technique, a lot of people will"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,242,252.0,choose those artists and not see that they will 10 - 15 years from now look very dated
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,249,256.0,perhaps or may not be the best person to adopt as a parent.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,253,262.0,"And then the next thing is we don't want just one stylistic influence, we want to have more"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,259,265.0,than one thing so that we can combine them and make something new.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,262,271.0,"Stan: Well, if you just choose one parent, you pretty much just become like a replica right?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,268,272.0,Marshall: That's right.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,269,273.0,Stan: You're just becoming a rip-off.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,270,280.0,Marshall: I have had more than one student who chose Frazetta and one in particular really
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,277,281.0,locked onto Frazetta -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,278,282.0,Stan: Just Frazetta...
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,279,287.0,Marshall: He loved Frazetta and he copied Frazetta and he had a style like Frazetta
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,284,294.0,and then he broadened it out by choosing Boris.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,291,296.0,It was not - it was not -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,293,298.0,Stan: Isn't Boris just rip-off of Frazetta?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,295,300.0,Marshall: And so what you get is -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,297,301.0,Stan: Right?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,298,302.0,Marshall: Yes.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,299,309.0,You get inbred. You get a thing that makes it so you instead of branching it out and saying who's different
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,306,310.0,"from Frazetta, how can I -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,307,311.0,Stan: What do you take from Boris?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,308,314.0,Marshall: His technique looks more like Boris.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,311,316.0,Stan: Is it the over-exaggeration of the anatomy?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,313,318.0,Marshall: No it's the really refined technique.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,315,322.0,"You know, Frazetta has a refined technique at certain points and a lot of points he lets"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,319,324.0,it go into pea soup.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,321,326.0,"Stan: Right, he's got a little more looser."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,323,331.0,"Marshall: Yeah, whereas Boris has got more oiled up bodies and really - real control"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,328,335.0,over the photographic reference and that kind of thing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,332,342.0,"But that is exactly an example of someone who's so enamored with someone that they like, that they're just"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,339,347.0,going to collect - I'm gonna collect all parents that are all of the same type and
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,344,353.0,Stan: I'm gonna adopt the children of that parent as my other parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,350,354.0,Marshall: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,351,357.0,"Stan: You're inbreeding, you don't want to do that."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,354,359.0,Marshall: It's something that they have to be a lesson.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,356,361.0,We have to little have - a little talk about genetics here.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,358,362.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,359,366.0,"Ooh, gross."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,363,373.0,Marshall: The choice of your parents makes a big difference in how you develop as an artist.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,370,382.0,"So, we start to break down attitudes and skills and styles and if you're doing sci-fi and"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,379,390.0,"fantasy, it makes perfect sense that you're going to adopt parents who are sci-fi fantasy artists."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,387,395.0,"But if that's all you do and you don't go outside of that, it means that you are going"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,392,398.0,to be rehashing a lot of the same.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,395,403.0,"So, we deal with this and the best way to deal with it is to actually they have you"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,400,409.0,get your stuff out in front of you and speak to those specific issues.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,406,415.0,"Sometimes it's attitude, some people are great painters and great at composition and great"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,412,420.0,at all the technical stuff about painting but they pose everybody in fake poses.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,469,476.0,kinds of characters that he wanted to do and then he had a particular comic book artist
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,473,480.0,that he liked for the stylistic technique; the outlines and the way the gradations are handled.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,477,486.0,"And so, by making the choice that I'm going to combine these specific elements of these"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,501,505.0,Stan: Decide what you like.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,559,565.0,Stan: We have to have a talk about the candy and cheese thing.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,609,616.0,"kind of thing which you may say ""I love fake poses and I'm gonna do it""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,613,622.0,But to have somebody warn you that you may like this person and they do dress well but

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,624,630.0,will be dominated by everybody else and they don't know how to stand up for themselves.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,627,635.0,To have the insight of someone who is further along to point some of those things out so
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,632,641.0,that it's not just - or I can use myself as an example; I was influenced by Big Daddy
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,638,648.0,"Ed Roth, I was influenced by the mad artists, I was influenced by underground comics artists,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,645,652.0,I was influenced by a lot of lowbrow stuff and the first master that I ever copied was
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,649,654.0,Albrecht Durer.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,651,658.0,"And Albrecht Durer, I was drawn to his stuff, I still think it's marvelous."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,655,665.0,"But it is so awkward, he has no gesture, everybody looks like they're built out of bricks that"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,662,673.0,are about to tumble and I think I picked up that quality from him and then spend decades
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,670,675.0,trying to get past that quality.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,672,679.0,I don't know whether to blame Albrecht Durer for my awkward drawing qualities or whether
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,676,680.0,I should say that I was just -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,677,681.0,Stan: You should blame yourself.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,678,682.0,Marshall: Drawn towards -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,679,684.0,Stan: Get some responsibility in your life Marshall.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,681,685.0,Marshall: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,682,691.0,"Yeah I take responsibility for the fact that I have awkward vibes in me, I want to find"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,688,696.0,"someone else who's great and awkward so that I can lock on to them and say ""see, Albrecht"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,693,701.0,"Durer was awkward, so it's okay for me to be that way"", I'm taking full responsibility."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,698,708.0,"Stan: So, you're saying what if you want to have bad table manners but your teacher says"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,705,710.0,"""watch out, that guy has bad table manners""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,707,716.0,"Marshall: Well think - Robert Williams really loved Big Daddy Ed Roth, he publishes Juxtapoz"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,713,720.0,magazine and he was part of that - all of those great underground artists along with
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,717,724.0,some others Todd Shore and some other people like that took what Big Daddy Ed Roth and
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,721,729.0,amped it up even more and brought better painting skills to it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,726,736.0,Todd Shore in particular could take that - that lowbrow look and bring amazing painting skills to it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,733,741.0,"But Robert Williams and Todd Shore are examples of someone who said ""I'm going to take the"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,744,749.0,So yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,746,757.0,"Stan: So, I guess - I would disagree with having somebody to tell you what to take out of these parents."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,754,762.0,"You said to have a - the mentor that could like look and tell you ""hey, watch out for the bad table manners""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,759,769.0,I think you should just decide what you like about them and what you don't like about them.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,766,771.0,You don't have to like everything about these parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,768,775.0,You might like something specific and you take that specific thing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,772,780.0,Marshall: You're bringing it back to the creativity which is that you decide I want this quality
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,777,782.0,and this quality and you might want to blend them together.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,779,787.0,I fell in love with MC Escher when I was 18 years old - 19 years old.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,784,792.0,"When I first saw his work I thought ""oh, this is what I want to do""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,789,797.0,But I didn't like his line drawings and his characters all seemed like they didn't have
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,794,803.0,"any of the qualities that I loved from Mad comics, so what ended up happening, I wasn't"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,800,807.0,"even consciously doing, it was just happening anyway, like you pick up your parents habits"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,804,814.0,by osmosis is that I was trying to do Mad Comics characters with Echer rendering.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,811,820.0,"Stan: Yeah, it was probably that a battle between the two at first and then eventually"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,817,824.0,you kind of figure it out which - like what are you gonna take from here what are you gonna take from here.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,821,828.0,"Eventually this starts to - you find the way they connect, right?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,825,832.0,"Marshall: Actually, the images came to me really vividly in my imagination."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,829,833.0,"Stan: Oh, really?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,830,837.0,"Marshall: Yeah, that if Mad were rendered out, but then trying to work it out was - you"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,834,838.0,"know, that was a task."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,835,841.0,"How about you, who are your artistic parents?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,838,848.0,Stan: My parents are not autistic.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,845,852.0,"Sorry, that was so stupid."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,849,856.0,"Marshall: I'm so glad, it makes me feel good by comparison."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,853,859.0,Stan: My artistic parents...
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,856,861.0,"Let's see, I had several."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,858,866.0,Obviously I'm influenced a lot by Jeff Watts who I studied with for like ten years -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,863,867.0,Marshall: I can see it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,864,871.0,Stan: And a lot of the other teachers there are influenced by him.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,868,875.0,"And so I was influenced by all the teachers there who were all influenced by Jeff Watts,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,872,877.0,so it all kind of stems from that.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,874,884.0,"But then I really liked Morgan Weistling for a very long time, it was his brush Manship"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,881,885.0,that I really enjoyed.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,882,886.0,Marshall: I don't know him.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,883,887.0,Stan: You don't know Morgan Weistling?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,884,888.0,Marshall: No.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,885,891.0,"Stan: Oh well, he's a fine art painter, so he's not in the illustration world."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,888,893.0,"Well, actually he was, he was for a very long time."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,890,899.0,He had a full on - he did movie posters for a long time and then one day he just decided
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,896,902.0,he's gonna be a fine art painter and then he just exploded.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,899,909.0,He sold out his first one-man show I think like in the first night or something.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,906,910.0,But anyway - Marshall: What years was this?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,907,911.0,Stan: He's still alive.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,908,912.0,"Marshall: Oh, he's still alive!"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,909,916.0,"Stan: Yeah, he's middle-aged, not even old."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,913,920.0,"He's very good, look him up Morgan Weistling but I liked his brushmanship."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,917,925.0,"I didn't necessarily want to do the same kind of subject matter as him, he did a lot of"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,922,929.0,"like very life type of stuff, some religious stuff."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,926,930.0,I really just like this brushmanship.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,927,940.0,I had his DVD where he painted a girl doing homework and I watched that DVD every night going to bed.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,937,945.0,"I just put it in, it would be like my sleep aid for like two years."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,942,949.0,"Not every night, but you know what I mean, like very often."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,946,954.0,I watched it a lot and it was just - I was just absorbing his way of mixing color and
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,951,962.0,his way of putting the brushstrokes down and how he tiled skin tones transitioning from shadow to light.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,959,964.0,"I was just absorbing, it was great."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,961,967.0,Marshall: And that was after Watts or before Watts?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,964,968.0,Stan: During Watts.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,965,970.0,"Yeah, this is while I was studying at Watts."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,967,971.0,Who else?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,968,973.0,"Steve Houston, I was really influenced by his drawing style."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,970,974.0,"Marshall: Yeah, I can see it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,971,976.0,Stan: Not his painting style but his drawing style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,973,978.0,"Man, who else?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,975,984.0,"I mean, a little bit of bit of - those I think are the big ones and then a little bit of"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,981,989.0,"like Norman Rockwell, like the illustrators for some like shape design and stuff like that."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,986,996.0,"I like the look of a slightly caricatured portrait like 10%, like Rockwell would do and"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,993,1001.0,"then - oh, never mind, this is huge, a lot of the Russian painters, I'm very heavily"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,999,1003.0,"Marshall: Great painters, true. Stan: Yes."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1000,1007.0,Repin and a lot of the - even just their Academy student work.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1004,1016.0,"I would study that for just learning how to draw, not necessarily to fit into my style"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1013,1021.0,but just like wow they have such a great academic style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1018,1022.0,"Which means like no style, right?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1019,1023.0,Kind of like -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1020,1028.0,"Marshall: But it's discipline, really understand everything that they're doing, there's not"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1025,1031.0,anything in there left to chance unless is by choice that it's left to chance.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1028,1032.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1029,1039.0,I think actually they frowned upon that style as being like your style nowadays.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1036,1044.0,That's like you're - you learn that on school and then you - when you're done you leave that.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1041,1048.0,A lot of them just like completely change after that.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1045,1055.0,"I don't think they think of that as the end goal, this is just the way we studied, this"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1052,1058.0,is how we learn and then we go and figure out how to be artists.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1055,1062.0,"Marshall: That sounds great, that's how's the way to do it is you've got such a solid"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1059,1068.0,grounding that you can kick off into any direction you choose.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1065,1069.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1066,1073.0,Which actually brings me to another point I wanted to make about style is that a lot
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1070,1081.0,"of beginners use the excuse of style for their mistakes and I'll tell my beginners, I'm"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1078,1086.0,"not talking about when you've already mastered all the fundamentals and you know how to explore,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1083,1090.0,I'm talking about in the beginning when you don't even understand how to render form and
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1087,1097.0,"a teacher comes by and tells you that your edges are all too - they're all too similar,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1094,1101.0,you have to have some soft edges and some sharp edges based on the forms and you say
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1098,1105.0,"""but that's my style"", I want to use a curse word here -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1102,1109.0,"Marshall: Now, here's where you're getting into trouble though, because a teacher will"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1106,1114.0,"come along and say that and it's like ""yeah, but that is their style -""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1111,1117.0,"Stan: No it's not, it's not their style, it's every beginners style."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1114,1123.0,"Marshall: They can point to a thousand people who have got that beginner style and say ""these"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1120,1124.0,"are my parents""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1121,1130.0,"Stan: No, your parents are not every person that doesn't know how to draw, that's the"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1127,1131.0,stupidest expression ever.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1128,1132.0,Marshall: Who made up that rule?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1129,1135.0,"Stan: Fine, you're an idiot"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1132,1136.0,congratulations.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1133,1137.0,Sean: Your parents are babies.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1134,1140.0,Stan: You chose babies as your parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1137,1142.0,Exactly.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1139,1146.0,"Yeah, you don't choose babies as your parents."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1143,1147.0,You'll never learn to walk.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1144,1151.0,Marshall: Okay I wanna - can I chime in here on bad influences?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1148,1152.0,Stan: Sure.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1149,1159.0,Marshall: You did this video recently with Court about how to make digital look traditional?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1156,1163.0,"Stan: Wait, sorry, I'm still laughing in my head about your parents are babies."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1160,1169.0,Marshall: Didn't you recently do a video with Court about how to make digital look traditional?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1166,1173.0,"Stan: Yeah, I mean Court did all that, I just proof read it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1170,1178.0,"Marshall: One of the things that I see over and over and over with students, I mean, countless"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1175,1183.0,"times is they're working online, they're working on drawing, they're working on draftsmanship,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1180,1188.0,they're working on good things but they work in Photoshop and they find out that with Photoshop
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1185,1192.0,you can put gradations of tone in things and they put gradations of tone in things and
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1189,1198.0,"this gradation - gradation is exciting, gradations change that graydate, there's something nice about them."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1195,1203.0,"But when they're done with no knowledge about how the form is turning, and they're also"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1200,1209.0,done with no awareness of how it's affecting the eye for the whole composition -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1206,1212.0,Stan: But those - so your're talking about beginners doing this?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1209,1214.0,"Marshall: Yes, but they're just learning their rhythm."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1211,1217.0,Stan: It's like a baby learning to speak going [Gibberish].
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1214,1218.0,Marshall: But they aren't.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1215,1219.0,Stan: They're not?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1216,1221.0,"Marshall: They aren't, they're just putting it in because everybody else did it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1218,1223.0,"So, here is my signal gesture -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1220,1224.0,Stan: But the babies learning to talk because everyone else is -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1221,1230.0,Marshall: With all respect for the babies.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1227,1237.0,"The thing about it is that when you are learning tone, learn tone."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1234,1242.0,"Stan: Yes, learn zone but while you're learning tone, try to apply what you know which might"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1239,1243.0,be almost nothing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1240,1247.0,"Marshall: Well, even if you say things that are facing the light, this direction and things"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1244,1251.0,that are facing the light - not facing the light this direction are going to gradate
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1248,1256.0,"and keep it consistent, that's a good start."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1253,1260.0,"And then you say you know, it doesn't just gradate, usually there's a point where there's"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1257,1266.0,"a core shadow there; ah, if we can make that core shadow, separate the two at the terminator,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1263,1270.0,"that'll look even better and usually when I first learned that, oh that's thrilling,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1267,1274.0,it makes it look realistic and then we'll say sometimes the terminator is a sharp edge
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1271,1279.0,"and sometimes it's a rounded edge so we can make it hard edged and we can make it smooth,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1276,1282.0,then we've lifted up to another level.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1279,1286.0,But that way we really are learning rather than doing what people - some students will
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1283,1291.0,put hours into these gradations with Photoshop and they look worse and worse.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1288,1295.0,"And here is the thing, they cannot see that it looks bad."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1292,1299.0,And anyone who's looked at pictures for a while feels like you would be better off just
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1296,1303.0,leaving tone out until you're ready to start applying it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1300,1308.0,"Stan: There's so many things that beginners do that make me cringe though, I mean - yeah,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1305,1313.0,"that's a Photoshop thing but there's like when you're learning to draw with a pencil,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1310,1321.0,like everyone just makes the shadows light and they outline everything and they make
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1318,1325.0,features bigger than everything else because they think they're important and they make
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1322,1329.0,"symbols out of features instead of drawing actual form, right?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1326,1332.0,They'll do a W for a note or like a triple W.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1329,1333.0,Marshall: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1330,1337.0,"Stan: There's an almond with a circle in for eyes, like yeah the beginner's make these"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1334,1343.0,"mistakes because they no yet but like they need to start trying, right?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1340,1347.0,"Marshall: Yes, and that's why choosing good parents is important."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1344,1352.0,"Stan: No, I totally - no, this is when you don't have parents."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1349,1355.0,"Like style, it should not be even in question here."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1352,1361.0,"If you're not good enough to render form correctly, you shouldn't be thinking about style."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1358,1368.0,"Forget about those parents, learn the science, mother nature is your parent for the first five years."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1365,1373.0,Marshall: Wow and I see you got these panels and stepped out of a church and we are starting
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1370,1376.0,to turn into a full - amen!
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1373,1377.0,That's so great.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1374,1378.0,Sean: Hallelujah
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1375,1382.0,Stan: Don't adopt parents until you're five years old.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1379,1384.0,"Sean: You're an orphan. Stan: Yeah, you have to be."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1381,1389.0,"Marshall: I want to point something out though about style, if you copy Leyendecker style"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1386,1396.0,"and you've got somebody there saying ""look at how he puts blue on that face, and he also"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1393,1399.0,"puts green on that face and they look right""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1396,1404.0,"Now, you try doing that and it's gonna look like there's green paint and green - and blue,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1401,1408.0,but he knows that all of these planes are facing one way and these other planes are
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1405,1409.0,facing another way.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1406,1412.0,"Stan: But that's not what people are gonna get when they're studying Leyendecker, they're"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1409,1415.0,gonna go for the cheap tricks that he uses.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1412,1417.0,Marshall: They'll get it if they've got somebody pointing it out.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1414,1421.0,"Stan: Sure, yes, get some good training of the fundamentals."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1418,1428.0,"But if you're saying adopt good parents like Leyendecker to learn the fundamentals, I don't know Marshall."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1425,1431.0,"Marshall: No, I don't think - not to learn the fundamentals but to say -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1428,1433.0,"Stan: For beginners though, well, we're talking about beginners."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1430,1438.0,"Marshall: Okay, if a beginner is - is learning the fundamentals and then you want to show"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1435,1444.0,"them, you want to see a really advanced classy use of the fundamentals because when people"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1441,1448.0,"look at Leyendecker's work, they think he used so many brushstrokes and what they don't"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1445,1452.0,seem to be aware of is he used fewer brush strokes than almost anybody else.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1449,1459.0,He'd rehearse his brush strokes so that each one would count as a graphic shape and also
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1456,1460.0,a part of the rendering.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1457,1465.0,"Stan: But that's the only thing people notice, they'll go ""whoa Wow, look at those strokes""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1462,1466.0,Marshall: But they were talking about -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1463,1467.0,Stan: We're talking about style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1464,1472.0,Marshall: We're talking about adopting your parents and style is one of the first reasons
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1469,1474.0,why anybody adopts a parent.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1471,1480.0,"I like the way this person does this this or this, but that can also be - Mort Drucker"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1477,1486.0,"was the great caricaturist who did the movie Satires and Mad Magazine, this was 60s all"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1483,1493.0,"the way through till even recently, and he could draw - he could go into the movie theater,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1490,1498.0,"look at movie stars, draw them from memory, caricature them so that they looked like themselves"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1495,1504.0,"and he had a wonderful fluid pen-and-ink style and when I was a kid, I tried copying that"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1501,1511.0,because it looked good to me but I had no idea why he had somebody chin overlap that
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1508,1513.0,part of their cheek.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1510,1518.0,"I had no idea why in these 3/4 views, one part was overlapping another."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1515,1523.0,"But it was the thing that eventually led me to say ""he's got some secret knowledge that"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1520,1526.0,"I don't have"" and that was that he knows the"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1523,1531.0,"So when you try to copy, when you try to be like that grown up, you start to say, well"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1528,1534.0,you need to do exercises before you're going to be able to get to that level.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1531,1535.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1532,1543.0,So when do you recommend for students or for artists to start adopting their art parents?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1540,1546.0,"Marshall: Right from the - right from the beginning, beginning of the training and not"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1588,1597.0,"Bob Duncan explained to me - he was a television writer and a novelist, I said ""how did you"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1616,1629.0,"And Bob had a unique novelist fiction voice, it was erudite and I read The Story of Philosophy"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1626,1639.0,and I could see Bob almost lifted that nonfiction historians style to write his espionage novels.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1636,1646.0,"So, that's an example of now we're crossbreeding, we're saying that instead of just copying"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1724,1733.0,is in the mid 19th century where you used a needle to put all these cross contours around
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1730,1739.0,those things and Bernie didn't know that that wasn't pen and ink and Franklin Booth didn't
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1736,1743.0,know that that wasn't pen-and-ink and Franklin Booth developed an entire pen and ink style

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1752,1761.0,"And then Bernie looked at Franklin Booth, Dore, they were huge influences on him, the"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1777,1787.0,got his education from the famous artists mail-order school that we were looking at

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1788,1795.0,Gnagy would teach you how to learn the simple forms and shade them.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1798,1803.0,Stan: So it's a box.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1800,1805.0,"Marshall: Yeah, it was very simplified."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1802,1811.0,But Bernie saw that when he was a kid and learned this stuff and then he - and he also
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1808,1815.0,"said - we asked ""what are your influences"" and he said Frazetta Frazetta Frazetta."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1812,1822.0,"In fact, he said ""I am Frank Frazetta s'illegitimate child""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1819,1826.0,"So, he was deeply influenced by Frazetta but he also had a number of other things that"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1823,1828.0,were pulling him around.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1825,1833.0,Frazetta didn't do that engraving kind of stuff that you see in Wrightson's Frankenstein.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1830,1835.0,Stan: Everyone has such a big boner for Frazetta.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1832,1837.0,Marshall: Well Frazetta was great.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1834,1841.0,You outgrow him I think because the way one of my colleagues who was very influenced by
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1838,1848.0,"him and I think in a number of ways grew out of him, he said it's all eye candy, it's just candy."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1845,1852.0,"Stan: It's good, I like Frazetta, I don't think he's bad."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1849,1856.0,"Marshall: But when you compare it to Howard Pyle, when you compare it to the best of Frank"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1853,1862.0,"Brangwyn, when you compare it to Wyeth, when you compare it to those really - I mean, even"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1859,1868.0,when you compare it - Rockwell is candy too but Rockwell is candy that is much more varied and rich.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1865,1873.0,"But yeah, I don't want to, I mean, dissing Frazetta is maybe -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1870,1878.0,"Stan: I don't want to diss him, I'm not dissing him, I'm dissing everyone's -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1875,1879.0,Sean: The pedestal he's on.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1876,1880.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1877,1884.0,Marshall: Have you seen the documentary Painting With Fire?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1881,1888.0,Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Yeah and you remember Simon Bisley mentioned something about Frazetta that was
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1885,1893.0,"the - a great insight, he said I wasn't - Frazetta style that interested me and then he said,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1890,1897.0,"the thing I liked about what's the power, he had this physical power in there, and that"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1894,1900.0,is one of the reasons why people really get excited about it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1897,1905.0,"There is something about his horses, his characters, these women on these horses, these are people"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1902,1911.0,if they hit you in the head it would break you apart and I think when you're
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1908,1919.0,"12-15-17 years old and you're not thinking about painting technique or Bridgman or draftsmanship,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1916,1924.0,"you just say, that looks more real, it looks more strong, it's more appealing to me, something"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1921,1925.0,about the physical energy in it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1922,1933.0,"And he was athletic, and he was so athletic that that athletic energy gets into the way he treats things."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1930,1939.0,Stan: I want to give people some action items of adopting their artistic parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1936,1946.0,"I see two different ways of adopting, well no, sorry, of developing your art style; one"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1943,1951.0,"is adopting your art parents, do master studies, just full-on copy."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1948,1960.0,"Pretend you are this person and do a painting or do a drawing and copy them, then do your"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1957,1963.0,own thing in that same style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1960,1971.0,"So not doing an actual master study but doing your own vision but in that exact same style,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1968,1972.0,that is one way.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1969,1976.0,The other way then is just to experiment.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1973,1983.0,Try to find out your own way of doing things because just adopting parents and combining
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1980,1987.0,"them in your own way, that's not the full picture; you have to also be an artist and"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1984,1993.0,"you have to be creative and just play, because you will make mistakes that kind of happen"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1990,1997.0,"and you're like ""wow, I like that!"", and things happen."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,1994,2003.0,If you have that mindset of exploration and just trying new things all the time.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2000,2008.0,"Marshall: Yeah, think about how we develop our own speaking voices, we listened to our"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2005,2013.0,"parents, we listened to people around us, we imitated them then we tried to say our"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2010,2020.0,own things and then eventually we will choose other people to learn to speak like them but
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2017,2026.0,"we'll also bring our own quality to it that comes out of our own emotions, our own intensity,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2023,2029.0,"our own casualness, whatever qualities we have that bring to it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2026,2031.0,But where does an accent come from?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2028,2037.0,"Nobody's born with an accent, the accent comes from the environment."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2034,2041.0,"And so, we're choosing to surround ourselves with these accents and then find out what"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2038,2043.0,it is when we turn it into ourselves.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2040,2047.0,"Also, everybody who's got the same accent doesn't sound exactly the same."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2044,2052.0,"So there is that balance of not being ""I want to adopt my parents, I want to learn from"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2049,2057.0,"my parents but I don't want to be my parents"", wouldn't that be boring?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2054,2061.0,Evolution would be boring if everybody was just a duplicate of their parents.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2058,2066.0,"There's supposed to be some kind of progression, some kind of developing our own thing."

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2064,2068.0,Marshall: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2065,2069.0,Stan: There's mistakes that happen.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2066,2071.0,Marshall: That's right and adjustments to the mistakes.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2068,2081.0,"And then ultimately, it isn't about the sound of our voice, it is about what it is we have to say."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2078,2085.0,Why are some people drawn to horror stories?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2082,2087.0,Why are some people drawn to romantic comedies?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2084,2092.0,"I mean, there is something in their thematically that they say ""this is what I'm about, I like"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2124,2132.0,That has a lot to do not just with style but it's more genre.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2129,2135.0,Storytellers have the same kind of issues.

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2217,2225.0,"combined Fechin with, I mean, who is a Russian artist but he was more of an American Russian artist."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2222,2227.0,Fechin definitely has his own style.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2224,2228.0,"Marshall: Yeah, he has a great style."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2225,2232.0,"There's more chaos in his style and his earlier style, that's what I love about it, there's"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2230,2236.0,Stan: But then also Jeff does have a little bit of his own flavor in there.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2233,2239.0,I can always tell of Jeff Watts.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2236,2241.0,"Yeah, I was highly influenced by it, I love - I still love it."

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2283,2290.0,my skills and then I just go through long drought periods.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2287,2297.0,"So, I'm wondering what your guys advice is for establishing a daily routine."

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2307,2314.0,Marshall: Do you want to do a prelude to it or should we take another question?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2311,2317.0,"Stan: Let's do a little, a quick one-minute thing about it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2314,2320.0,"Marshall: This is a motivation thing, isn't it?"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2321,2328.0,Stan: I guess we can adjust that part of it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2325,2334.0,"Go ahead. Marshall: Yeah, the on/off thing, there's two ways to deal with it; one is to embrace it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2331,2337.0,On/off is not that bad a thing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2334,2342.0,"It's - you say, ""I'm gonna have the times where I roll on it and the times where I set"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2348,2356.0,"so long that I'm never gonna grow, then my recommendation is get involved in community"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2353,2362.0,where you're held accountable and make it so that you've got someone who's expecting it from you.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2359,2370.0,I did not have this problem because I had clients who I had to get the job done or they

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2386,2394.0,and they have kids and they have to do that and then they also want to know - learn how to draw.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2391,2401.0,"I mean, the answer to that is like you can't really spend as much time as an eighteen year"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2453,2460.0,"But there's another thing, and that is this might not be the thing that draftsmen are"

vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2767,2774.0,Even if you just watch the first two and then take a break for a half-hour and then numbers
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2771,2779.0,"three and four will go really well together, again thematically and then five and six also"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2776,2780.0,work well together.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2777,2789.0,"But I just - the craft of this film is so excellent, they are so good at phrasing and"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2786,2794.0,timing and rhythm and credibility and what to show and what not to show.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2791,2797.0,"They're just - they are as good as it gets, so I was - I'm just very excited about it,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2794,2799.0,that's been my thing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2796,2800.0,"Stan: Cool. Marshall: How about you, what's your thing?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2797,2804.0,Stan: My thing this week is my son [awww].
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2801,2811.0,Marshall: That out does Buster Scruggs by about 300 million.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2808,2813.0,Tell us about Cooper.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2810,2815.0,Stan: Cooper...
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2812,2821.0,"He's getting to that age where he actually interacts right, and he can play really well"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2818,2822.0,Marshall: He's almost two?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2819,2824.0,"Stan: He's almost two, yeah."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2821,2831.0,"Like the other day, I was doing push-ups because I'm a man."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2828,2838.0,"You know, I was but anyway, he just climbed on my back and he just - I was like ""oh wow,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2835,2843.0,"he's actually sturdy on my back now."" and so I started crawling around the house, he loved it."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2840,2849.0,"Because before I was like, you know, he'd fall off, he'd could fall on his head, he couldn't do"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2846,2853.0,"that sort of stuff but now he's got his grip string, he's holding on to my shoulders, he"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2850,2856.0,"wraps his legs around, it's so fun, he's like a little human."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2853,2858.0,Marshall: A dad as a horse.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2855,2860.0,Sean: He stopped being a bean and now he's a human.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2857,2862.0,"Stan: Yeah, he's not a bean anymore."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2859,2866.0,"Marshall: Yes, I know that phenomenon, it's amazing."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2863,2870.0,Stan: Yes you do.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2867,2872.0,"No, that's just - yeah."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2869,2877.0,"He's in - like, God I'm speechless!"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2874,2886.0,"Oh, and I rolled him up into a taco, this happened like five minutes afterwards,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2883,2889.0,yoga mat.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2886,2893.0,He wanted to put the yoga mat over his head and make a tent and then I put him down on
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2890,2895.0,one end and I started rolling it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2892,2898.0,Rolled him into a taco and he loved it.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2895,2903.0,"He laughed so hard and then he wouldn't leave me alone, he just wanted to do that like 10"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2900,2910.0,times and then I scared him; I rolled him to a taco and walked away and he can't move right?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2907,2911.0,So he actually got worried.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2908,2915.0,"I was peeking around and he like ""oh crap, wait I can't move""."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2912,2919.0,"He realized he can't move, but I ran right back in, he didn't cry."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2916,2925.0,Marshall: So you are just loving the opportunity to be involved in raising this human being?
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2922,2926.0,Stan: Oh yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2923,2927.0,That's my thing.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2924,2929.0,Marshall: I can see why.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2926,2933.0,"People might not be able to pick it up when they're outside of it, but if they've been"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2930,2938.0,"around a two year old, yeah, you can't really know what it's like until you're around two-year-old"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2935,2942.0,"and know how exhausting they can be, but how how funny and delightful."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2939,2944.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2941,2945.0,Marshall: Well congratulations.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2942,2946.0,Stan: Thank you. Marshall: You've got Cooper.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2943,2947.0,Stan: Yeah.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2944,2953.0,All right. All the non parents are like
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2950,2954.0,Sean: I ate a burrito the other night.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2951,2956.0,Stan: I ate a burrito -
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2953,2961.0,"Marshall: I think you should include footage of Cooper rolling around the taco thing, everything,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2958,2965.0,"riding you, you've got to get all that in here the aftermath during the"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2962,2967.0,"credits of draftsmen, we get to see the real thing."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2964,2969.0,Sean: watch the YouTube video.
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2966,2974.0,"Stan: Well, thank you everyone for listening or watching, please leave us five stars in"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2971,2979.0,"iTunes, tell your friends, leave a comment."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2976,2981.0,"What's the comment, what comment should they leave today?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2978,2985.0,"Marshall: Let us know, this is the thing about art parents, if you've got questions -"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2982,2986.0,"Stan: Yeah, who are your art parents?"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2983,2990.0,"Marshall: Yeah, who are your art parents and is there anything that you would - we would"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2987,2994.0,"warn you against, was the outsider say ""no no no, don't adopt that parent"", you know,"
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2991,2995.0,"if there's anything like that, yes."
vxJOjvsj3j0,Adopting Art Parents to Develop Your Style - Draftsmen S1E05,2992,,"Stan: Alright you guys, see you next week, Tuesday, bye."
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,7,12.0,Thanks Oscar for the kind introduction
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,9,15.0,So it's a real delight to be here to talk to you all
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,12,19.0,Thanks very much for making it to the outer parts of Bristol
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,16,21.0,all the way here - I've never been here before
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,18,24.0,It's nice to speak in such a lovely environment
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,21,28.0,"So when I was asked to give a talk, I wondered for a while"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,25,31.0,about what it might be that I'd tell you
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,28,33.0,and you know the options were should I talk about my research?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,30,35.0,And programming languages? And maybe that would be
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,32,37.0,something that would interest people here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,34,41.0,And the other option was to talk about Computer Science in general
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,38,45.0,And I went for the latter option because what I want to present
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,42,48.0,is essentially some of the stuff that has interested me since I was a kid
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,45,51.0,stuff that brought me into computer science in the first place
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,48,54.0,"where I thought ""hey this is interesting"" and ""this is cool"" and ""I want to do that"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,51,56.0,"and ""I want to learn how to do that kind of thing"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,53,58.0,So it will be about programming languages per say
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,55,62.0,I mean it'd be much more about just cool things you can do with your computer
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,59,64.0,"And so the title of this talk,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,61,66.0,"""God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,63,71.0,is actually a play on a much grander quote by Einstein
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,68,74.0,"Einstein said ""God Doesn't Play Dice with the World"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,71,79.0,and what he was getting at there was his frustration with
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,76,81.0,"the quantum world, so essentially he's a physicist"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,78,85.0,and he's working on models of the world and how the world can be predicted
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,82,88.0,by a series of equations and how these things work out in practice
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,85,90.0,"you know, and all the details of that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,87,95.0,But the heart of quantum computing is this law that says something along the lines of
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,92,99.0,either you need to give up the determinism or you need to give up locality
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,96,103.0,"So in other words, either the world is made up of randomness, or there's randomness"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,100,106.0,"at the heart of the world, or for some reason,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,103,109.0,"we just can't predict what's going to happen, because stuff can affect the system"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,106,111.0,from the outside in a way we can't model very easily
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,108,114.0,So both of those options aren't very satisfactory to the physicist
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,111,117.0,"And Einstein didn't like this idea, and he said"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,114,119.0,"""God doesn't play dice with the world"" - he didn't like to accept"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,116,123.0,that non-determinism was a word we could have.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,120,129.0,So I'm thinking about the digital world and what that actually means
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,126,134.0,"So when I said the digital world, I'm talking about stuff you can model"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,131,137.0,on your computer and so where do I start if we're talking
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,134,138.0,about the creation of entire worlds?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,135,140.0,"Well, I thought I'd start at the beginning:"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,137,144.0,"""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,141,147.0,And I had plans of creating whole simulations
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,144,148.0,"of the world, starting with the oceans"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,145,151.0,"the ground and all that, but I only had a few weeks to plan this talk"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,148,153.0,so there was no way that that was going to happen
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,150,158.0,"So instead I sort of turned to common stuff, that is to say"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,155,163.0,computer games and computer games have ruled the world for quite some time
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,160,166.0,"and things have become quite complicated and you know,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,163,171.0,"in 2011, Man created... Minecraft"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,168,173.0,which I'm sure many of you here will have played
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,170,177.0,"So for those of you who have not played Minecraft, the graphics are"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,174,180.0,"intentionally ""blocky"" - they could have"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,177,182.0,been much better than this but they were not
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,179,185.0,and the idea with Minecraft is that you can create entire worlds and planets
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,182,188.0,"brick by brick, laying out exactly what each brick is,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,185,194.0,"whether that be sort of the seas, or the earth, or clouds, or what have you"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,191,199.0,"And part of Minecraft's beauty, I think, well I've never played it, but is that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,196,203.0,"you can walk round, this sort of infinite terrain in a particular direction,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,200,208.0,and see things like hills and seas and coastlines etc.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,205,211.0,and the point is that these worlds have not been generated or created
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,208,215.0,by a particular artist or an engineer or somebody who designed the place
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,212,218.0,to look like that - it's been created by a computer program
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,215,222.0,a computer program that decides to place things wherever it wishes
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,219,225.0,And it's been given certain rules about how things should be placed
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,222,229.0,But that's about it. So when you play Minecraft
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,226,231.0,you have no idea what's going to come up
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,228,233.0,You know roughly speaking that they're going to look a bit like this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,230,236.0,but you don't know the exact terrain in any detail
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,233,240.0,"so you get some cool screenshots like this and like this, where perhaps"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,237,245.0,there are some rock areas around. And so it's quite a rich world
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,242,249.0,So where did these kinds of programs start off?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,246,255.0,For many the story of procedurally generating words - that's to say
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,252,258.0,worlds generated by some procedure executed on a computer
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,255,264.0,"starts in around 1978. So there was a game called ""Beneath Apple Manor"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,261,268.0,"and the graphics were quite similar to those of Minecraft as you can see,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,265,274.0,They were completely text-based ASCII codes and the idea was that you had to
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,271,278.0,find a golden apple on floor ten beneath the Apple Manor
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,275,282.0,and what you can see here is a labyrinth - or one level of the labyrinth -
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,279,285.0,"looking top down, and these labyrinths were all generated procedurally"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,282,287.0,so this is one of the first artifacts of this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,284,289.0,This game was a precursor to so-called
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,286,292.0,"""roguelike games"" where you essentially have"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,289,296.0,"one life and you start at the top of the maze, you work your way through,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,293,298.0,"and if you die, game over - you start all over again"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,295,302.0,"or even if you get to the golden apple, game over - you start all over again"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,299,304.0,and the idea was just to get the best score you could
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,301,307.0,and people would still play these kinds of games today
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,304,311.0,our next stop would be 1979 and you can see here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,308,317.0,the graphics are really quite advanced - we're talking about 3D isometric views here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,314,320.0,"and again I'm kind of highlighting this one, not because of its amazing graphics"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,317,324.0,"but because this was an exploration game in the same way the one above was,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,321,328.0,where the world is being generated as well as the wonderful graphics
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,325,331.0,And then there's this one in 1984 which I want us to point out
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,328,336.0,"called ""Rescue on Fractalus!"". This one I want to point out because"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,333,339.0,"- so this is a flying simulation game, as you can see, you're in a cockpit,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,336,344.0,"very realistic - and the idea is that these jagged lines you can see,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,341,347.0,they are mountains. And the cool thing about
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,344,349.0,those again is that they're not created
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,346,352.0,"by artists, they've been generated by machines"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,349,356.0,"The from the sort of humble beginnings, we get cool things coming out"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,353,363.0,"Cool things being ""Spore"" in 2008 which was, you know, the new era of procedurally"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,360,366.0,generated games. It was a bit of a flop in the end I think? But the idea was that
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,363,371.0,"you could create - it was made by Maxis, the people who made The Sims"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,368,376.0,"and this was for a while, internally I'm told, named ""Sim Everything"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,373,377.0,"and it didn't end up being ""Sim Everything"","
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,374,380.0,"it was kind of ""Sim your own planet"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,377,384.0,"and ""Sim your own species"" in some sense. And you could make these things grow from"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,381,387.0,single cell things into other creatures
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,384,390.0,"And, again, all of that was procedure generated, all done by some machine"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,387,395.0,"and some algorithms in the background, deciding how things should work out"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,392,401.0,"To a more recent age - 2016 - so that's this year, there will apparently"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,398,404.0,"be the release of a game called ""No Man's Sky"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,401,408.0,and this has made big news in the gaming industry because
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,405,412.0,"again, of procedural generation, but it takes things to a whole new scale"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,409,418.0,"You start off with the model of a universe, where you've got a whole bunch of stars"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,415,422.0,"and you've got sort of galaxies, and everyone one of these little white dots"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,419,426.0,"is a star system that you can visit, so you can sort of fly in from this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,423,430.0,"universe perspective and in live time, you can fly into a particular solar system"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,427,434.0,you can encounter all kinds of spaceships and planets
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,431,439.0,"and you can dive into a planet there and then, fly down and see terrains like this,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,436,442.0,and then you might notice that these things are actually dinosaurs
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,439,445.0,and actually all these animals are being populated and created on the fly
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,442,448.0,so new species are being generated when you encounter them
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,445,452.0,"So all of that from the planets, the universe itself, to all the animals,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,449,456.0,the way the animals walk and where they are - that's all being generated on the fly
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,453,459.0,So what's the trick behind all of this? How is it possible?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,456,464.0,"I mean if you think about how we might do this very naively,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,461,466.0,how much memory could this possibly take?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,463,469.0,"If you're taking a picture of every sort of blade of grass, and every rock"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,466,471.0,in a mountain and every part of the universe
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,468,473.0,that would take loads and loads of memory
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,470,475.0,and you wouldn't fit it on your single laptop
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,472,478.0,But these games are creating entire universes and they can fit on your PC
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,475,481.0,"and you can run these things, so there's some kind of trick going on"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,478,484.0,And that's sort of what we're going to be looking at
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,481,489.0,So these digital worlds are created essentially as a combination of two things
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,486,492.0,They are the combination of noise on the one hand
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,489,494.0,- and I'll define that in a while -
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,491,497.0,and on the other hand fractals. So these two things put together
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,494,500.0,is what gives you the kind of richness that we're talking about for these worlds
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,497,504.0,"And before I talk about those, I wanted to just think a little bit,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,501,508.0,"or talk a little bit, about what I mean by ""random"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,505,512.0,"When we say ""random"", we usually think about numbers that are quite arbitrary"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,509,517.0,"and in Amazon, you can go and buy this book. This book is called"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,514,520.0,"""A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,517,523.0,and you can look through this book and see all kinds of random numbers
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,520,527.0,"Isn't that great? And if you look at the reviews, they're quite interesting,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,524,530.0,"these reviews. They say things like - so four stars, ""almost perfect"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,527,535.0,"""Such a terrific reference work. But with so many terrific random digits,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,532,537.0,it's a shame they didn't sort them to make it easier
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,534,541.0,"to find the one you're looking for"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,538,544.0,"One star - ""sloppy"". ""The book is a promising reference concept,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,541,547.0,but the execution is somewhat sloppy. Whatever
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,544,549.0,generator they used was not fully tested
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,546,552.0,"The bulk of each page seems random enough, however the lower left and lower right"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,549,557.0,"of alternate pages, the number is found to increment directly"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,554,561.0,"And then another one ""Quite the opposite of random when viewed globally"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,558,564.0,"""At first I was overjoyed when I received my copy of this book"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,561,568.0,"However, when an enemy in my department showed me HER copy, I found they"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,565,573.0,"were the OPPOSITE of random - they were IDENTICAL"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,570,576.0,"Okay, so what is it we mean by ""random"", exactly?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,573,579.0,"Well, maybe we mean random is this?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,576,584.0,So here is what I call a program. It's a very small program
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,581,589.0,"So at the top you can see that the name of the program is ""Random"" and this colon here"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,586,592.0,"tells me, you know, what this program is going to do"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,589,594.0,Well what this program does is returns an integer
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,591,598.0,"And in this case, we say ""random = 7"", which means whenever you ask Random"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,595,603.0,"for a random number, it gives you the random number 7. And that's it, right?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,600,607.0,So there is a bit of a problem - this always produces the same number
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,604,610.0,I wouldn't think of this as being terribly random
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,607,613.0,Maybe we could advance the technology a little bit and think about
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,610,615.0,how else we can make random numbers
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,612,619.0,What we can do is come up with a slightly more complicated version of Random
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,616,625.0,So random now takes as an input an integer and produces as its output
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,622,627.0,a different integer - a random number
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,624,632.0,"So here we go. We'll call the number coming in ""the seed"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,629,636.0,and the idea is that this seed will plant a sort of random value
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,633,639.0,"which can be used to build the next random value and so on, so forth"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,636,642.0,So the next random value will be a new seed that we use in the program
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,639,645.0,and so that's going to be our source of randomness in some sense
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,642,650.0,What does this random do? Well it takes a seed and it produces 7 x the seed
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,647,654.0,"So if you say random with a seed of 1, then it'll say 7"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,651,657.0,"and if you then use that number 7 as your next seed, then it'll say 49"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,654,660.0,"and if you use that next seed, then you make 343"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,657,664.0,"So we get sort of random numbers, right? 7, 49, 343?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,661,668.0,"Hmm, not really. The problem is that this doesn't produce certain numbers,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,665,671.0,"it's really predictable, this is just a terrible random number generator"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,668,674.0,There are all kinds of things we could say are wrong with this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,671,680.0,So we can improve this a bit more. Maybe we want to sort of Mod 11 this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,677,682.0,So what we're doing here is we're pretending that the numbers
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,679,686.0,"that we get back are on a sort of clock cycle, so whenever you get to a number"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,683,690.0,that is more than 11 you're going to start counting again from the beginning again
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,687,694.0,"And so random of 1 =7, random of 7 = 5, and round and round we go"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,691,696.0,until we eventually hit something like random
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,693,699.0,of 8 = 1. And we go back to the top again
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,696,705.0,"So this is random, right? You've got the sequence 7, 5, 2, 3, 10, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,702,710.0,"Random. Except again, this isn't very satisfactory as a random sequence"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,707,713.0,It hits the idea that we're using all the
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,710,715.0,"numbers from 1 to 10, so maybe that's random"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,712,719.0,But what I mean by random isn't just that it's this sequence of numbers
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,716,723.0,"in fact this isn't random enough in the sense that when we say random of 1,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,720,727.0,"we're always going to get 7. And so if I keep using the seed 7 here,9"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,724,728.0,"that keeps coming back, and then we see it back,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,725,731.0,"and then this seed here on the right hand side, back as the input"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,728,735.0,"it's just going to loop the sequence 7, 5, 2, 3, 10, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,732,737.0,over and over and over again. It's extremely predictable
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,734,742.0,Because give it a certain input and you're going to get exactly the same output again
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,739,751.0,"Again, not satisfactory. So what we'll do is modify the function yet again"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,748,753.0,and think about a slightly different version of what's going on
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,750,757.0,We're going to say that the input is the seed - that's going to stay the same
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,754,761.0,And the output is going to be a pair of things. It's going to be 2 integers
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,758,766.0,"On the one hand, a random value, and on the other hand, a next seed"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,763,770.0,And the idea here is that we're decoupling the generation of the random number
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,767,775.0,"from the generation of the random seed, and so we'll keep on feeding the seeds back in"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,772,781.0,"so random of one makes vales 7 and the seed 13, and 13 will get fed back in"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,778,785.0,"Random of 13 makes the values 3 and 169, and we feed 169 back in"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,782,787.0,and round and round we go
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,784,791.0,The idea is that now our random sequence is going to look like
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,788,797.0,"7, 3, 6, 7, 7, 4 and we're getting repetition of 7, but just because you had"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,794,800.0,"a 7 last time, doesn't mean you can predict what the next number is going to be"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,797,802.0,which you could on the last way of doing randomness
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,799,805.0,This is in some sense much better because you're not getting the same
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,802,808.0,sequence of numbers over and over again. It will repeat at some point
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,805,811.0,but it's much less predictable. And the way that we're doing that is that
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,808,815.0,we're just doing different things with the new seed and the random number
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,812,818.0,and that's all that we're outputting
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,815,821.0,So that's better. It's better but it's by no
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,818,823.0,means perfect. There are much more advanced
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,820,825.0,ways of producing random numbers than we are doing here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,822,829.0,"Ways where even if you knew the method of producing the next random number,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,826,832.0,"you still couldn't predict what the next random number was, in some sense"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,829,834.0,"Things can get very complicated, and the"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,831,836.0,people here who do cryptography will be able
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,833,840.0,to go into much more detail than I am going to go into here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,837,845.0,So that's randomness for you. The next concept that we want to think about is
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,842,848.0,"this concept of noise, because noise and fractals is what makes"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,845,854.0,these artificial worlds possible. Let's think about where noise came from
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,851,857.0,"in the first place. Noise, or at least"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,854,861.0,"procedural noise, had its beginnings in Tron"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,858,866.0,So Tron was a film which I very much enjoyed as a kid - I think it was produced
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,863,872.0,in around 1982-83 or so and the idea was that the protagonist was launched into some
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,869,878.0,"digital world where he was inside the computer. And being inside the computer,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,875,883.0,"the graphics looked something like this, where everything was made of polygons"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,880,885.0,that were constructed in a very regular way.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,882,890.0,"Sure it looked like an entire world, and for the time this was advanced stuff"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,887,896.0,but really the lead director of the technology behind making this film
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,893,901.0,"Ken Perlin, was a bit frustrated. He said ""on some level I was frustrated by the fact"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,898,904.0,"that everything looked machine-like"". So he didn't like the fact that this looked"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,901,908.0,"so blocky, he didn't like the fact that this didn't look organic"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,905,911.0,And it was at this period when he was making this film that he started thinking
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,908,914.0,"""How can we make computers create things that look a bit more organic,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,911,916.0,"a bit more like the stuff that we see in the real world?"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,913,921.0,"So the idea that he had was to make this thing called ""Perlin Noise"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,918,927.0,"And I'm going to vastly simplify things, but roughly speaking, he's saying"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,924,931.0,let's take a whole bunch of random numbers and scatter them like this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,928,935.0,"and between each of these random numbers, so the way to view this is,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,932,939.0,"we're looking at a hill, starting on the left hand side, moving across"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,936,944.0,to the right hand side. And we can connect the dots. If we connect those dots
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,941,948.0,"in a smooth way, then you'll get something like this. And this is the idea that he had"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,945,951.0,that you can kind of build terrains in this particular kind of way
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,948,956.0,"and you can imagine not just plotting dots on a one-dimentional graph, but rather"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,953,960.0,"on a two-dimentional plane, and then you try to smooth around those points"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,957,963.0,as you go through. And the trick around Perlin Noise was really how he did
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,960,970.0,that smoothing off. And so he wanted to have nice terrains that bounced around
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,967,973.0,"a bit like Tellytubbyland, where the hills were very very smooth"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,970,979.0,and that's what he accomplished. The problem that we need to think about though
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,976,981.0,"when we're doing this, and generating hills in this way,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,978,988.0,"is if these values really are random, then say if you're at location 10 on your path"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,985,992.0,"then the height at location 10, will be sort of randomly generated every time"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,989,996.0,"so sometimes it'll be that the height will be 0.5, and the next time it could be 0.7"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,993,998.0,next time it could be 0.3 - it would bounce around
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,995,1003.0,"So even though you're looking at the same location, if that point of space"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1000,1006.0,"is randomly generated, the height is randomly"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1003,1007.0,"generated, then what you're going to do"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1004,1009.0,is when you walk around and go back to the
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1006,1011.0,"point where you began, well, the ground will"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1008,1014.0,have shifted and changed and it won't be the original thing that you were at
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1011,1018.0,The problem is that if every value where you're walking around
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1015,1023.0,"really is random, then you're not really looking at normal geometry"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1020,1025.0,"if I walk across the river and come back again, I would expect the ground"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1022,1028.0,to be roughly the same height and that's not what would happen
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1025,1030.0,if we were using random values
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1027,1035.0,So the solution that Ken came up with was to
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1032,1037.0,use your particular position as your seed
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1034,1041.0,so rather than using the sequence of moves you've made to get where you are
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1038,1046.0,"as your random seed, he used the position you're currently at as the seed"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1043,1048.0,What that means is when you're at a
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1045,1050.0,"particular place, even though a random value"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1047,1053.0,"has been generated, the seed is remaining exactly the same"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1050,1056.0,which means it's the same random value as you had before
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1053,1061.0,"So the terrain doesn't randomly change, actually it's a random value, but"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1058,1063.0,it's the same random value at the same particular position
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1060,1067.0,And so this allowed him to create worlds where you could walk away and back again
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1064,1074.0,and you'd come back to what you'd feel like being the same place
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1071,1077.0,When you take this and you extrapolate into 2D you get
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1074,1082.0,a world which looks a bit like this - it's probably not easy to see with the
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1079,1086.0,projector - but roughly speaking that he'd use these lighter areas of blue
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1083,1091.0,are going to be mountainous areas and these darker areas are going to be valleys
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1088,1097.0,You get an entire world surface like this when you extrapolate into 3 dimensions
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1094,1102.0,The problem with this is that it's really boring - it's really boring because the
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1099,1107.0,"world just sort of ungulate back and forward, and there's no kind of detail here"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1104,1110.0,"there's nothing interesting to look at. If you look at our planet,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1107,1113.0,when you walk around there's all kinds of interesting details outside
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1110,1117.0,"the ground goes up and down at the minute level, as well as the grand scale"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1114,1121.0,and here it's all kind of homogenous and boring in that sense
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1118,1125.0,So that's where Ken looked into using Fractals to make things
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1122,1128.0,be just a bit more interesting. And fractals
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1125,1130.0,are something that I've been interested
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1127,1134.0,in for quite some time. Here is probably one of the most famous fractals
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1131,1138.0,"It's ""The Mandelbrot Set"", which in some sense is very self repeating"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1135,1141.0,"so you can see the whole thing here, but you can see sort of aspects of itself"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1138,1147.0,as you look through. If you zoomed in to particular parts of The Mandelbrot Set
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1144,1152.0,"you'd see things like this, or like that, or like this. Again this part here,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1149,1156.0,"is some zoomed in part of The Mandelbrot Set, which is very self similar"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1153,1160.0,to The Mandelbrot Set as a whole.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1157,1163.0,And so this is kind of one of the first fractals that you would see as being
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1160,1167.0,"""wow, this is beautiful!"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1164,1171.0,It's sort of related to the question of the Coastline Paradox
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1168,1179.0,"So, the question here is, if you wanted to know how big the coastline"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1176,1182.0,"of Britain was, or how many miles you'd have to travel to walk all the way"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1179,1185.0,"around the coastline of Britain, what would the answer to that question be?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1182,1188.0,"So to first approximation, you might say, well I'm going to use these yard sticks"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1185,1192.0,to just roughly approximate and say if the yard sticks are 200km wide
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1189,1200.0,then maybe the whole of the UK has a circumference of 2400km
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1197,1204.0,Fine. But what if you took a slightly smaller unit? What if you did a 50km link?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1201,1208.0,"Well, it turns out that the length around the UK is now 3400km, so this has gone up"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1205,1213.0,"by quite some margin. And so when people calculate the perimeter of the UK,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1210,1215.0,"I'm not too sure what they're talking about,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1212,1216.0,because I don't know how they're doing it
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1213,1219.0,"It could in fact be a lot bigger than this, and in fact, I'm not too sure what"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1216,1223.0,"the upper bound of it could possibly be, because you could imagine this yard stick"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1220,1225.0,"not being 50km wide, but a kilometre or maybe a metre,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1222,1227.0,or a centimetre or a milimetre wide
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1224,1230.0,How big is this number going to be when you start going round and round and round?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1227,1235.0,"Well, his part of the answer - there are these things called ""Koch Curves"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1232,1240.0,which start off as single lines. So you've got a single line that
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1237,1245.0,starts like this. And the idea is that I'm going to replace each line
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1242,1249.0,"with a line that has a kink in it, like that. So I'm just going to stick"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1246,1251.0,a little triangle where there used to be a flat line.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1248,1254.0,"And so wherever where there's a flat line, I'm going to do that one more time"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1251,1256.0,So - pop. It comes out like this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1253,1261.0,"And then I'm going to do that one more time again, and again, and again and so on"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1258,1263.0,"And eventually I will get something that looks a bit like this,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1260,1265.0,but in more more detail than what's here
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1262,1269.0,"So this is an example of a fractal, because it is self similar. As you zoom into"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1266,1273.0,"a particular part of this curve, it will look like the outer part"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1270,1277.0,So how do we define one of these things in a computer?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1274,1281.0,"It's not too difficult. What you can say is, you can say well look,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1278,1286.0,"at the first iteration, 0, all I need to do is go forward 1, like this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1283,1290.0,"At any other iteration, so if I want to go into a further level of detail,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1287,1292.0,what am I going to do?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1289,1296.0,Well I'm going to look at this middle section and look at the angles
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1293,1299.0,between these things. So here it is as if I started walking here on the left hand side
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1296,1303.0,"and walking to the right, and at this point I want to turn left by 60°"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1300,1309.0,"then I walk forward and here turn right by 120°, I walk forward then turn left by 60°"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1306,1315.0,"So what I'm saying is, actually, I want to turn left by 60, turn right by 120,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1312,1318.0,and turn left again by 60. And what's all this stuff in the middle?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1315,1320.0,"Well, actually, rather than just being straight"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1317,1323.0,"lines here, I want to call Koch again,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1320,1328.0,but with one value less than it was before. So this thing gets more and more detailed
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1325,1334.0,"as we go down. And so this definition here, says ""do the curve one level down"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1331,1337.0,"than it used to be, and then turn, and then do the next one,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1334,1339.0,"one level down than it used to be"" and so on and so on"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1336,1343.0,So we're getting a recursive function that calls itself and gets more and more
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1340,1346.0,"complicated as you go down, but in the same kind of way"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1343,1350.0,"We might be interested in asking ourselves the question, well what is the perimeter"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1347,1353.0,"of this thing? How long is this line, you know, that we've just defined?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1350,1357.0,"I mean, familiar shapes have finite area and perimeter, so a square has an area of,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1354,1361.0,"you know, 9 and a perimeter of 12 so it looks like this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1358,1364.0,"If you have a 3, 4, 5 triangle, then the area is 6 and the perimeter is 12"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1361,1367.0,"If you have a circle, then you have some area and some perimeter attached to that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1364,1372.0,"Fine. So, what about this curve? This snowflake thing that I'm trying to look at?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1369,1377.0,"Well, so you've got the straight line, and you've got the kink just once,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1374,1380.0,and then the next version and so on - what if we just started counting the length
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1377,1384.0,"of these things? I mean, the area is clearly bounded by something"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1381,1389.0,"it's less than some value, less than 1x1x1x1 square"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1386,1394.0,But what about the length of this thing? So if we just plot here the segment length
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1391,1398.0,"so these things get smaller by a third at each iteration, and the number of segments,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1395,1401.0,we're just counting how many times that we're drawing lines
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1398,1403.0,"and the total length, and we get something like this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1400,1408.0,"And you can see the total length is going up. And in effect, if you keep on going up,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1405,1411.0,"what happens if you did this ten times, you'd get 13 or so"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1408,1415.0,"25 times you get almost 1000, 50 times it's some large number"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1412,1417.0,"and then 100 times, it's a really very large number"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1414,1424.0,"And as it turns out, the length of this curve as you approach infinite 'n's"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1421,1431.0,"itself tends to infinity. So even though we have a curve that sits in finite space,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1428,1434.0,"with finite area under the curve, it has an infinite length"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1431,1439.0,"So back to the Coastline Paradox, how long is the coastline of the UK?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1436,1444.0,"Well, I'm not sure. Is it infinite? Can we have infinitely small measurements around"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1441,1448.0,every grain of sand? And every little detail? Probably not
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1445,1451.0,"And it'd be quite a hard exercise anyway, but it certainly tends towards infinity"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1448,1455.0,And that's sort of an interesting point in itself
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1452,1461.0,So actually the whole discussion about the UK and coastlines and how big
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1458,1467.0,"are the coastlines, was first discussed by Benoit Mandelbrot, whose name is attached"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1464,1472.0,"to that picture we had at the beginning. And he likes to say, well at least he said"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1469,1477.0,"""Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules, which are repeated without end"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1474,1481.0,"So you get these really fascinating behaviours, or fascinating looking pictures"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1478,1485.0,from very simple things that you just keep on repeating time and time again
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1482,1492.0,"So one joke that I quite like regarding Mandelbrot, is that his name is"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1489,1499.0,"Benoit B Mandelbrot, and you might wonder what the B in Mandelbrot stands for"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1496,1503.0,"and if you look and think hard, but maybe not too hard, you'll notice that B"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1500,1507.0,"could stand for Benoit B Mandelbrot, which then the B would stand for"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1504,1511.0,"Benoit B Mandelbrot and then, you get the picture"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1508,1515.0,"So anyway, silly joke. So how are these worlds created?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1512,1517.0,So these words are created by noises and
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1514,1519.0,fractals interacting in some interesting way
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1516,1525.0,I've talked about noise and how these random values allow you to create surfaces
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1522,1528.0,"and they were a bit boring, and fractals give you sort of,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1525,1530.0,this very interesting geometry. So how do the two get put together?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1527,1536.0,"Well, the idea is that you start off with some lines, some values dotted around"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1533,1541.0,"in some random way, and if you increase the number of dots that you're plotting"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1538,1547.0,"as you go down this axis - let's say you start off with, just say, ten dots"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1544,1551.0,"and then you create 20 and then 40 and so on as you go down, then you're going to get"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1548,1555.0,more and more jagged lines as you go downwards
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1552,1559.0,"But, if you add then these two curves together, you'll end up with something"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1556,1562.0,"that looks like this. If you add these three together, you'll get this,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1559,1565.0,"and if you add these four, you'll get this, and if you add all of them together,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1562,1569.0,"you'll get something like this. Where the trail on the bottom right hand side here,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1566,1572.0,is much more interesting than a just a kind of plain old Tellytubbyland
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1569,1576.0,it's something that has nooks and crannies and all sorts of details and features
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1573,1578.0,that make it look much more interesting
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1575,1581.0,And that's sort of the secret to lots of these procedurally generated universes
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1578,1584.0,"is that they're making it so that the more closely you look at something,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1581,1587.0,"the more detailed it becomes. And you can keep on looking closer,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1584,1590.0,"and it will keep on getting more detailed, because what they're doing is adding"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1587,1593.0,more and more detail in this exact manner
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1590,1598.0,"So when Ken did this, he started off with the simple noise here on the top left,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1595,1602.0,"and then by changing the way that he adds these different layers together,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1599,1605.0,"these sort of bits of procedural noise, he ends up with these pretty cool"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1602,1608.0,looking surfaces. This one here looking like marble
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1605,1612.0,and all kinds of different effects he has. That's something that he wrote about
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1609,1616.0,But he was much more interested in not sort of creating worlds although this might look
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1613,1619.0,"like he was, he was interested in creating different textures"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1616,1622.0,"So how do you create a marble texture, or how do you make a texture that looks"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1619,1624.0,a bit like fire - that sort of thing
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1621,1628.0,The person who decided to take this and really run with it to make procedurally
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1625,1634.0,generated plants was Ken Musgrave. And he ended up making these kinds of pictures
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1631,1639.0,in the 90s which started to look a bit more like realistic planets and
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1636,1643.0,realistic places - and that's all based on all the kinds of ideas
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1640,1644.0,that we've been talking about so far
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1641,1648.0,So that's something that's well worth exploring if you're interested
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1645,1652.0,in these kinds of things. And I certainly had a lot of fun when I was a kid.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1649,1658.0,"So changing tact slightly, we've seen very roughly how you can create an entire planet"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1655,1662.0,"surface out of these simple rules, but what about life?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1659,1665.0,What about things that are a bit less predictable than just ground?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1662,1670.0,The worlds that we've been dealing with so far have been planets where you kind of
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1667,1673.0,walk around and things never change. Things never move around.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1670,1678.0,"You can make it so that things change with respect of time, so that the place"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1675,1684.0,is slowly - the continents can drift slowly as time proceeds. That's easy enough to do
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1681,1686.0,using all the techniques that we've talked about
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1683,1689.0,But what about creatures? What about things that can move?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1686,1694.0,Or things that can replicate? What about real things that can change in a time where
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1691,1696.0,you can't predict in advance?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1693,1699.0,So the first thing that comes to my mind is the Game of Life
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1696,1702.0,"and when I talked to my wife about the Game of Life, the first thing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1699,1706.0,"that came to her mind was this Game of Life, which is a great Game of Life,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1703,1708.0,but not the Game of Life I had in mind. This
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1705,1710.0,"is a great board game from, I don't know,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1707,1715.0,maybe the 80s? But the one I'm thinking of was Conway's Game of Life
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1712,1717.0,which is rather quite different
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1714,1724.0,"So Conway's Game of Life, is quite a simple game. It's a game involving a"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1721,1728.0,"two-dimensional grid, like this, and a whole bunch of different stones"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1725,1735.0,on that grid. So here we have 5 stones. And the idea is that these 5 stones
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1732,1739.0,are going to move around the grid or change as time evolves
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1736,1742.0,based on a few very simple rules
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1739,1746.0,"So the rules go something like this: First, there's the rule of isolation"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1743,1751.0,"which is to say if you have a stone in a particular place, and it has"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1748,1755.0,"less than two neighbours, then it will die"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1752,1760.0,So here are some examples of stones in this situation so
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1757,1764.0,"This one, if you look at the 8 neighbours that surround it, there are none"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1761,1767.0,So this one is marked to die in the next round
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1764,1770.0,"If you look at these two, they each have 1, and so they're marked to die"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1767,1772.0,in the next round - so I'll mark that with a square
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1769,1775.0,"And say these are going to die off. So in the next round, in the next iteration"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1772,1777.0,"of this world, bang - they're gone"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1774,1781.0,"So that's the first rule. The second rule, is replication"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1778,1786.0,"So the idea here is if you look at the empty squares in this board, if you have"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1783,1790.0,"exactly 3 neighbours, then, well, something will come to life because it's"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1787,1796.0,"a prosperous region, okay? So there are all kinds of places where you have 3"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1793,1800.0,So let's first deal with the isolated neighbours. The ones that are isolated
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1797,1804.0,"in this diagram are these ones, but the ones that will benefit from replication"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1801,1807.0,"are these empty squares, where they have exactly 3 neighbours"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1804,1810.0,"And so in the next iteration, the isolation is going to happen,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1807,1813.0,and the replication is going to happen as well. Both of these things
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1810,1816.0,will happen at once. So what you get is the world is going to change
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1813,1820.0,"from what it is now, into this. So we have suddenly things are flipping round"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1817,1824.0,"and changing, which is quite interesting in itself"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1821,1829.0,"And then there's one more rule that Conway came up with, which was the idea"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1826,1833.0,of suffocation. So what happens if there are too many neighbours?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1830,1838.0,What if the resources are too contended for in a particular region?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1835,1843.0,"So we have these stones which are isolated, these are the points that are replicated"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1840,1847.0,and then suffocation means that you have greater than 3 neighbours
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1844,1851.0,So each of these marked blue squares have got more than 3 neighbours
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1848,1853.0,and so they will die off in the next round
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1850,1856.0,"So, with these different rules, what you end"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1853,1859.0,up is with this is the state of markings
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1856,1862.0,"and in the next round, everything's going to flip around and you're"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1859,1863.0,going to get something like this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1860,1868.0,"So that's what the state looks like, and again you can apply the same 3 rules"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1865,1872.0,"to this new state, so again you can identify where everything is"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1869,1875.0,"and that changes again, and you get a whole new sequence of things"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1872,1879.0,"So going back to what we started with, it was something like this, and then"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1876,1882.0,"if we apply the rules once we get this, and then we apply again and get this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1879,1886.0,Conway designed these rules over the period of several months
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1883,1890.0,and he designed these rules in such a way that it was very difficult
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1887,1894.0,"to predict how things would evolve over time. He had simpler rules,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1891,1898.0,"or different rules, to start off with, where eventually all the stones"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1895,1901.0,would die off all the time. He had other rules where the stones would suddenly
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1898,1906.0,grow very crazily and explosively. And this was the set of rules that he chose
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1903,1910.0,because he couldn't work out very easily what was going to happen
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1907,1913.0,when these things were launched off. And so there were all kinds of questions
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1910,1919.0,"that he asked when he had this. So he said, ""Can things move infinitely"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1916,1924.0,"in any direction?"" Is it possible to have some kind of life-like thing that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1921,1926.0,that spreads off in an arbitrary way? And the
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1923,1927.0,answer to that was posted something like
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1924,1932.0,"a month after he asked it on the internet, somebody said ""Yes, here is the answer"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1929,1933.0,"You can make these things called gliders,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1930,1935.0,"which sort of float across in some direction"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1932,1938.0,"Then the other question was ""Can the number of live cells increase?"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1935,1941.0,"Is it possible to have something not just that glides, but sort of produces children"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1938,1945.0,"and for that thing to increase. And the answer is yes, that's very possible."
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1942,1949.0,"No problem. And then he asks the question, something like, ""Will the game"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1946,1953.0,"go on forever or halt?"" So is it going to be the case that, you know,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1950,1957.0,"eventually these stones are going to repeat themselves in some sense,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1954,1959.0,that the pattern is very predictable in some
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1956,1960.0,"cyclic way, or maybe things are going to"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1957,1963.0,just stop at some point with the end of the story
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1960,1967.0,What exactly could happen? Is there a way of predicting this?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1964,1970.0,And people scratched their heads and no answer came
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1967,1979.0,So no answer came until they realised that you could model the Game of Life
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1976,1983.0,or you could use the Game of Life to model a Turing Machine
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1980,1985.0,So I'm sure that not everyone here knows what a Turing Machine is
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1982,1989.0,The Turing Machine is really related to the idea of computation
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1986,1993.0,"So we should probably look at that, before we understand what that result means"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1990,1997.0,"So what do I mean by ""computation""?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1994,2000.0,"Well, there's this saying - it says that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1997,2002.0,"""Computer science is no more about computers"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,1999,2005.0,"than astronomy is about telescopes"", which Michael Fellows once said"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2002,2009.0,"So the analogy here is people like astronomy, and that's great, and they're"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2006,2013.0,"exploring the stars and the origins of the universe, and they use"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2010,2019.0,telescopes to do that. Great. But these people are using telescopes as a tool
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2016,2022.0,to explore something much grander. And computer science is something very often
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2019,2025.0,easy to misidentify people as being interested
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2022,2027.0,in computers for the computers' sake
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2024,2030.0,"themselves, when also they might actually be interested in something"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2027,2032.0,"more grand than that in some sense,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2029,2035.0,what you can do with the nature of computation itself
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2032,2037.0,"Now, this is definitely an exaggeration,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2034,2039.0,because there are all kinds of people who are
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2036,2042.0,"computer scientists, who will say, actually I am just interested in the computers"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2039,2046.0,"and that's fine, right. But there will be those who are computer scientists who"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2043,2049.0,"are not just interested in computers, they are interested in computation itself"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2046,2053.0,In the same way that some astronomers might be very good at knowing how the telescopes
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2050,2057.0,"work - in fact, it's an engineering art in its own right - but it's not the same"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2054,2060.0,"as understanding astronomy, and so it's not the same as understanding"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2057,2062.0,"the hardware of computer, as it is understanding concepts"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2059,2065.0,"behind what computer science is, what the ideas behind recursion are"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2062,2070.0,"what the ideas behind computation, or how you can make things happen is"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2067,2077.0,"So, in fact, this point is so easily made in a sense, because the word ""to compute"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2074,2080.0,"means ""to determine by mathematical means"" - that means that you have"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2077,2084.0,"a rigorous way of approaching a problem, and a rigorous way of getting to an answer"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2081,2088.0,"So that is the mathematical means that we are talking about, that is what it means"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2085,2094.0,"to compute. And a computer is ""a person that computes"" and the definition actually"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2091,2100.0,"was used back in 1646, you know a hundred years before Babbage was even thinking"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2097,2103.0,"about machines, which is well before computers actually existed"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2100,2107.0,"So what a computer is, is not a machine, is not an iPhone,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2104,2111.0,"is not this thing that you've got, it's a person, well actually it's a thing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2108,2114.0,that can do a process. The process is the thing that we're interested in
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2111,2116.0,- the computation
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2113,2119.0,So Alan Turing invented the so-called Turing
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2116,2121.0,"Machine in 1936, again this is pre-dating"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2118,2126.0,"when actual machines were invented, and to this day, the model that he had of what"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2123,2131.0,a computer should be remains the most powerful thing that we have in terms of
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2128,2134.0,understanding what a computer could be. There is no model of computation
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2131,2136.0,that we have that is more powerful than what he conceived
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2133,2140.0,So it's worth understanding a little bit about how simple that model is
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2137,2143.0,It's surprising that this is what you can get out of computation
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2140,2146.0,Here is a so-called Turing Machine.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2143,2151.0,Now the Turing Machine is a very simple thing - it consists of a single tape
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2148,2156.0,- that's to say a big roll of paper - and he was envisioning somebody sitting
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2153,2159.0,"with a big roll of paper in front of them, and all they do is they look"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2156,2162.0,"at a single spot beneath where they are, and they read that single spot"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2159,2165.0,"and then they, as a result of reading that spot, they decide something"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2162,2169.0,"They decide, okay, am I going to read the next thing to the left, or the next thing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2166,2172.0,"to the right, or am I going to stop doing stuff?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2169,2174.0,And the other thing they decide is what am I going to rub out
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2171,2178.0,and replace that value with? Or am I just going to stop altogether?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2175,2183.0,"So roughly speaking he's saying, you have somebody, who starts off in some state"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2180,2188.0,"they say, well okay I'm in State A. I'm going to do A-like things."
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2185,2195.0,"And if I see a 1, then I'm in an A-state - what I'm going to do is just write 0"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2192,2198.0,"where I was looking, I'm going to go into State B, and I'm going to move"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2195,2203.0,1 off to the right. So that's the rule we have in this exact instance
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2200,2206.0,"We're in State-A, we're looking at a 1, we're going to move to the right"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2203,2211.0,And we change that value from being a 1 to being a 0
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2208,2215.0,"Now we're in State-B, we can asks ourselves again, well I'm in State-B"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2212,2218.0,"and what I'm looking at is a 1, so this is the rule I want to fire off"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2215,2223.0,"and what I want to do is just go to the left, replace this 1 with a 0,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2220,2225.0,and then go to State-A. So it's just a very simple process
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2222,2230.0,"And this simple process, it might look like it's a bit silly and easy"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2227,2235.0,"and too simplistic, actually is enough to model everything that's going on"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2232,2238.0,"in any computer you've ever encountered, and in fact, any computer you ever"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2235,2243.0,"will encounter. So even though this thing is remarkably simple, the beauty is"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2240,2246.0,"in that simplicity, because now that we have a very simple model of the world"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2243,2252.0,"or of computation, analysing this model will be enough to analyse any computer"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2249,2255.0,that could ever come into existence
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2252,2259.0,"I could follow a few more rules and see what's going on. And I was in a train once,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2256,2264.0,"talking to somebody, and what he asked me was, he said"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2261,2267.0,"""Oh you're a computer scientist"" and we chatted, and he said ""well, computers"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2264,2270.0,"are getting more and more powerful. Can they do anything?"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2267,2274.0,"And you know how about tell the future? One day will Google be able to do that?"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2271,2279.0,And the answer that Turing would give would be no - there are limitations
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2276,2284.0,"Even if you had a computer with infinite memory and infinite time, there are"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2281,2286.0,still things that a computer can't do
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2283,2291.0,"So very briefly, and there's this thing called the ""Halting Problem"" which Turing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2288,2295.0,"identified as something that computers cannot and could never do, no matter"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2292,2299.0,"how powerful, no matter how fast, no matter how much memory you throw at them"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2296,2305.0,They will fail at this problem. So let's get a feel for what this looks like
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2302,2310.0,"This little square here represents a computer, it's a computer called ""eval"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2307,2312.0,and what it does is it takes arithmetic
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2309,2314.0,"operations such as 3+4, and it evaluates that"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2311,2318.0,and tells you the answer is in this case 7. Or you could give it 3 x 14
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2315,2322.0,"and evaluate that and it will give you 42. Okay, so it's a nice little machine"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2319,2325.0,You give it some arithmetic stuff and it produces answers - fine
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2322,2330.0,Here's a slightly different machine - it's called Halt - and whatever input
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2327,2334.0,"you give it, if it's 3 + 4 or 3 x 14, or whatever you like,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2331,2338.0,"all it will do, is it will stop and say ""done"". It's not going to do"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2335,2339.0,interesting apart from that
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2336,2343.0,"And the last computer that you have is a computer that's called ""Loop"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2340,2347.0,"and you give it some input, and what it's going to do is going to loop forever"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2344,2350.0,"That's to say that it's just going to get very very hot, but never give you an answer"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2347,2352.0,And it's just going to turn and turn and turn.
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2349,2355.0,It's like the progress bar that never ends
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2352,2361.0,"So, can computers compute anything? Well, here's a computer that Turing identified"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2358,2368.0,as not being possible to create. The idea is it identifies programs that will stop
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2365,2373.0,"or not - the term is where something ""halts"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2370,2378.0,"So it takes as its input a program, so it actually takes another machine in"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2375,2381.0,as its input or a description of a machine - think of that as being the blueprint -
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2378,2385.0,it executes that blueprint on the given input that it has
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2382,2389.0,and it decides whether or not the machine that is taken in as input will halt or not
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2386,2393.0,Will it stop computing at some point or will it carry on forever and loop?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2390,2396.0,"So can we build an 'H' like this? Well suppose that we did, right?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2393,2403.0,"Well, if we gave it eval of 3+4, the answer to that would be yes. That does halt"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2400,2406.0,"It gives you the answer 7. So 'H' doesn't really care what the answer is,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2403,2408.0,it just cares whether or not this process finishes
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2405,2413.0,"If you gave this program 'H' the halt, regardless of the input, it would"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2410,2416.0,"always just say yes, that's the end, this thing halts"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2413,2419.0,"And if you give this thing loop, regardless of the input, it would say no,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2416,2422.0,"this thing doesn't halt, it carries on forever"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2419,2428.0,"So can it do anything? Well, we're not sure if it can build one of these 'H's yet"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2425,2431.0,"But there's a proof that we can't, and it looks like this"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2428,2436.0,"Suppose we started with an H machine like this, and if the H machine says yes,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2433,2440.0,"then we're going to loop forever. And if the H machine says no,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2437,2443.0,then we're going to halt and say we're done
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2440,2446.0,"So, what I'm going to do is wrap that whole thing inside a box and say"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2443,2450.0,"this is my computer, and it's called the ""H+"" machine, and the H+ machine"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2447,2453.0,"takes in some program, takes some input, feeds it through this thing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2450,2458.0,"and then if H decides that the program will halt, then H+ will loop,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2455,2463.0,"which is a bit weird, and if H decides that this thing does not halt, then H+ will halt"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2460,2466.0,So it's a bit backwards in that sense
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2463,2471.0,So what happens when we feed H+ into the H+ - that's the question
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2468,2477.0,"So we're one of two cases - either when you feed H+ into H, it says yes,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2474,2481.0,"this thing stops - or when you feed it to itself, it'll say no. One or the other"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2478,2485.0,There can be no other options. So let's pretend that we want the first one
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2482,2487.0,Let's see if that's going to possibly be the case
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2484,2491.0,"So we're going to feed H+ H+ into this machine, and we know that this H"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2488,2495.0,"is going to say yes. And so because it says yes, this thing loops -"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2492,2500.0,"but hang on a minute, because this thing is looping, that means it's not halting"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2497,2503.0,which means that the answer of this H should have been no
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2500,2506.0,"So, we have a bit of a problem. We're in a contradictory state"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2503,2511.0,"It can't be the case that this H says yes here. So bang! That's no good, right"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2508,2516.0,"So what about the other option. The other option is, okay, we feed this thing"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2513,2520.0,"into itself, and then what do we get? Well exactly the same situation happens"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2517,2526.0,So let's play that through. This machine will say no when you say H+ H+
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2523,2529.0,"That means that this thing is going to say no, this thing does not halt"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2526,2533.0,And as a result it will halt. But the thing is we've just promised
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2530,2535.0,that it shouldn't halt so we're in trouble
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2532,2538.0,"And because we're in trouble in both cases, this is a complete catastrophe"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2535,2541.0,"And it's a catastrophe that we can't recover from, and there is no way"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2538,2546.0,we could ever have a computer that does this
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2543,2551.0,That's sort of the end of what I want to say on the technical side
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2548,2555.0,"and in some sense, even if you have rules as simple as the Game of Life"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2552,2559.0,"in your computer, you can't get answers to things like the Halting Problem"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2556,2564.0,You can't predict whether or not a system will halt. There are certain machines
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2561,2566.0,that you cannot create
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2563,2570.0,"So as I said, ""God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World"" - and I wonder"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2567,2577.0,what could God do if he had infinite computing power and look at our world?
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2574,2582.0,"So we've looked at sort of the digital world, but what about our world?"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2579,2585.0,Suppose we don't have any randomness. Suppose that everything is determined
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2582,2588.0,and that God can look into the future and look into the past
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2585,2591.0,"and everything will be the same. Maybe he can, maybe he can't"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2588,2594.0,Suppose it's even as simple as that. Well in
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2591,2598.0,a world where there's sort of computation
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2595,2601.0,if God had a computer that could look at our machines and work out whether
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2598,2604.0,"they could stop or not, we still have a problem, because God"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2601,2609.0,can't solve the Halting problem. He can't know whether a computation will terminate
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2606,2612.0,"Even if he executes it, even if he executes the universe, he still"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2609,2615.0,can't tell whether it will terminate. Unless he has a magical oracle
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2612,2618.0,"that tells him, ""oh actually, this program will stop"""
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2615,2620.0,"That's sort of outside knowledge. But Turing goes further, and he says"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2617,2624.0,"""well okay, even if God had a machine like that"" - that's to say a computer"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2621,2627.0,"with an oracle - ""he would need an oracle oracle to be able to tell whether or not"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2624,2630.0,"a computer with an oracle can halt"" and up goes the problem"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2627,2634.0,"When people say that God is all-knowing, what they're claiming is that God"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2631,2638.0,"has a super powerful computer, that not only solves the Halting Problem,"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2635,2641.0,"but solves the Halting Problem with an oracle and two oracles, and so on and so on"
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2638,2643.0,Which is a pretty interesting thing in itself
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2640,2647.0,So these are the crazy reflections that you might have as a computer scientist
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2644,2650.0,looking at how computation works out in the world
woAMjVRd80g,God Doesn't Play Dice with the Digital World - BoB 2016,2647,,And so I'll leave that at the end. Thank you

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,56,60.0,Thank you guys for coming today.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,57,64.0,And thanks for helping build something I use every day.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,61,66.0,It's a different world as a result of what you guys are
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,63,70.0,"doing, and it's pretty cool."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,67,72.0,I wanted to talk today briefly--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,69,73.0,"maybe, a little too briefly, we'll"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,70,75.0,just scratch the surface--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,72,79.0,about the creative process.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,76,81.0,There's a lot of pixel peeping that goes on in the industry
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,78,83.0,of digital photography.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,80,89.0,"And, in many ways, those subjects can be the easier"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,86,91.0,things to discuss.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,88,95.0,"Sometimes, maybe we don't talk about the creative process,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,92,101.0,"how we got where we got, where we started, why we ended up"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,98,102.0,where we ended up.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,99,105.0,"Those are, sometimes, a lot harder to discuss."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,102,107.0,"And in part, I think that's because it's"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,104,109.0,a process of discovery.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,106,111.0,"Particularly as artists, we don't always know what our end"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,108,114.0,result is until we get started.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,111,117.0,"But somewhere along the way, we start to get clues, like"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,114,118.0,solving a mystery.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,115,121.0,We find pieces that start to fit together.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,118,124.0,And we do get into certain creative modes and perform
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,121,128.0,"certain creative operations that are repeatable, can be"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,125,131.0,"consistent, that we can share with other people."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,128,133.0,And those are the kinds of things I want to discuss
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,130,136.0,somewhat today.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,133,138.0,One definition of creativity-- and I know that there are a
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,135,139.0,lot of them.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,136,141.0,You can find a whole collection of quotes on
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,138,142.0,creativity on my website.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,139,143.0,I collect quotes.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,140,149.0,"And I put 'em out on my social networks including, Google+--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,146,152.0,"is to create a shift in perspective, to see things in"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,149,153.0,a new light.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,150,155.0,And one of the things that I wanted to do is share some of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,152,158.0,"the stories behind a few of my images, both as a visual"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,155,162.0,introduction to the kinds of things that I do and as a way
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,159,165.0,of sharing how being engaged in a creative process--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,162,167.0,"and I really like to talk about it as creative process,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,164,169.0,"not necessarily engaged in photography, not necessarily"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,166,172.0,"engaged in drawing, not necessarily engaged in writing"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,169,175.0,"or any of the other creative operations, modes, media, that"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,172,179.0,"I use synthetically, holistically in my process--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,176,182.0,"when you engage in that, your perception shifts."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,179,185.0,We do this in part to understand the world a little
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,182,188.0,"better and also to understand what's inside of us, which is"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,185,190.0,often one of the hardest things to bring to light and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,187,192.0,one of the reasons that I make the types of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,189,196.0,images that I make.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,193,200.0,Robert Frost said something that I think is wonderful.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,197,203.0,"No surprise to the writer, no surprise to the reader."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,200,207.0,So I think that process of discovery has to start here
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,204,211.0,"with each of us in a creative process, so we have to be"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,208,216.0,"creative with our process, and that each one of our processes"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,213,217.0,will change over time.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,214,220.0,"And then, each one of ours is unique."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,217,222.0,There's a different state or a different flow
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,219,224.0,at different times.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,221,226.0,So I want to share some of the stories that have changed the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,223,230.0,way that I think about making images and think about
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,227,234.0,"photography, or just images in general."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,231,236.0,One of the reasons I got involved with photography is
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,233,238.0,that photography can show us so much.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,235,242.0,And I think one of the best things about photography is
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,239,244.0,that it can record so much detail.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,241,247.0,And one of the worst things about photography is that it
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,244,249.0,can record so much detail.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,246,252.0,"And the big question then is, is what's inside the frame"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,249,254.0,significant detail?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,251,256.0,"Secondarily, how do we know?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,253,258.0,One of the things that attracts me most to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,255,260.0,photography is that it can freeze a
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,257,262.0,fast-moving moment like this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,259,265.0,I can sense these complex relationships
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,262,268.0,"dimly, perhaps diffusely."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,265,270.0,But they're moving too fast for me to really consider them
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,267,273.0,at length and to compare them to patterns before and after
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,270,274.0,and how they change.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,271,276.0,"There's something about the still image, being able to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,273,278.0,"freeze really complex relationships, that's really"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,275,280.0,quite fascinating.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,277,283.0,You could look at Eadweard Muybridge's work and how it
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,280,286.0,"changed the way that we think about time and motion, how it"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,283,290.0,answered the debate of whether a horse's hoofs are all off
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,287,292.0,the ground as it runs.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,289,295.0,"One interesting question becomes, at what point do we"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,292,301.0,stop verifying our own perception and rely on the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,298,305.0,"documents, the objects that we create, as a way of deciding"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,302,307.0,what's real or truthful.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,304,310.0,"We're in this very interesting time, where we're becoming"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,307,311.0,increasingly cybernetic.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,308,314.0,And we're deferring that notion of the eyewitness to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,311,315.0,the tools that we use.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,312,317.0,"And we have to be careful about that, because we're"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,314,319.0,"deeply involved in the creation of the tools, the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,316,322.0,"objectives, how they're used."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,319,326.0,Objectively only happens by degrees.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,323,328.0,What you know changes what you see.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,325,330.0,What you see changes what you know.

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,332,338.0,And I think it's one of the reasons why a visual creative
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,335,339.0,discipline is so important.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,336,340.0,"Because the more you can see, the more you know."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,337,344.0,"And the more you can see in many ways, well, you"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,341,346.0,can see even more.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,343,352.0,I find it fascinating that a viewer's knowledge base
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,349,354.0,changes the questions that they ask.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,351,356.0,And I think is so important ask questions.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,353,358.0,"Photographers will often come up to me, look at this image,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,355,360.0,and ask how did you get that exposure?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,357,361.0,There's very little light.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,358,364.0,"I know that that long exposure, the light on the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,361,366.0,"water, should have blurred to this mist."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,363,368.0,How'd you get that?

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,379,383.0,"I mean, there are rules to the game."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,380,384.0,But there are many different rules.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,381,386.0,One of the challenges in photography is we have only
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,383,388.0,one word for photography.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,385,391.0,"Now, are we talking about Jerry Uelsmann's surrealism,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,388,393.0,or are we talking about James Nachtwey's frontline
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,390,394.0,documentary?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,391,396.0,We expect very different practices as a result.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,393,398.0,But we have one word for them both.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,395,400.0,"And that, to me, seems woefully lacking."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,397,403.0,We need to update our whole concept so that we can
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,400,405.0,communicate more clearly.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,402,408.0,Look at what writers Can you imagine having one word for
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,405,411.0,"writing a screenplay, fiction, poetry?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,408,413.0,"Well, how about just fiction and nonfiction?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,410,416.0,It's a lot more elegant than photograph and photo

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,415,419.0,What kind of photo illustration?

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,420,425.0,you see where I'm going.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,422,427.0,We need to update our language.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,424,429.0,Astronomers ask me entirely different questions.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,426,432.0,"They say, where did you find that constellation?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,429,434.0,I don't recognize it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,431,435.0,"I said, yes, you're right."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,432,439.0,I painted it in Photoshop to make it look more like my eye
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,436,442.0,sees and less like the hard colored points that sometimes
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,439,446.0,streak in the camera.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,443,450.0,"So based on their knowledge base, they're looking at it"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,447,452.0,"totally differently and making different assumptions, and"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,449,453.0,bringing something different to the game.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,450,455.0,And I think we have to understand that our viewers
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,452,458.0,are always bringing something to the game of looking.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,455,459.0,And it as a game.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,456,461.0,There are rules.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,458,462.0,There's a context.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,459,464.0,"But also, it's fun."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,461,465.0,It's really interesting.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,462,466.0,It's like solving a mystery.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,463,468.0,We all see different things.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,465,471.0,"One of the reasons this is my favorite image, probably, is"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,468,474.0,not only because it started a whole new relationship with
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,471,478.0,"one of my, well, formal obsessions to symmetry."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,475,481.0,It's been a great device to suggest that other things have
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,478,484.0,a life and a spirit but also because it highlights this
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,481,486.0,"process of the viewer's involvement, and it enriches"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,483,491.0,my understanding of my own work.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,488,494.0,"One evening in a gallery, a gentleman reeking of Scotch"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,491,496.0,"and smoke came up to me and said, I love"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,496,501.0,And I'm looking around the room.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,498,503.0,And he leads me to this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,500,505.0,And I kept asking him what he was up to.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,502,507.0,But I didn't share my original thoughts or what I was
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,504,511.0,"thinking at the time, because it changes over time."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,508,512.0,It gets more complex.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,509,513.0,It grows.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,510,516.0,"Because I thought he was sufficiently inebriated that,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,513,519.0,"well, I have this deal that if I share what I share, I first"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,516,521.0,get the other person to share what they felt.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,518,522.0,And I don't want my
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,519,524.0,interpretation to supplant theirs.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,521,525.0,"I just want the two, the exchange, to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,522,527.0,enrich the whole thing.

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,529,534.0,Where should we hang it?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,531,536.0,You're not hanging that in here.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,533,537.0,Why not?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,534,538.0,It's dirty.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,535,540.0,"What do you mean, It's dirty?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,537,542.0,It's an x-ray of somebody sitting on a toilet.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,539,543.0,Can't you see?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,540,545.0,[LAUGHTER]
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,542,546.0,JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: Just keep going.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,543,548.0,Just keep going.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,545,550.0,One of the other things that I got and one of the best
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,547,553.0,"compliments of my career from a four-year-old, who crossed"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,550,558.0,"the threshold and stopped, held his breath."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,555,560.0,"I said, OK, I don't care how often it sells."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,557,561.0,I don't care where it gets collected.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,558,565.0,"If you can catch the breath of a four-year-old, success."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,562,566.0,"And then, the arms go flying."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,563,567.0,And he starts sputtering.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,564,569.0,It was the first time I really was happy there was glass in
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,566,571.0,front of my prints.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,568,575.0,"And he says, it's, it's, it's a giant sneeze."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,572,576.0,"And I'm sitting over in the corner of the gallery,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,573,579.0,"watching this whole process, thinking, I titled it Avra,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,576,581.0,which is the Sanskrit word for breath.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,578,584.0,"Breath, sneeze, close enough."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,581,587.0,And it's interesting to ask just how specifically we want
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,584,591.0,to communicate our intention and how often it gets looser
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,588,592.0,"and, yet, there still is a common"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,589,593.0,"connection, a common thread."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,590,596.0,And I think we want to look for that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,593,598.0,Sometimes the stories that other people have shared about
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,595,600.0,my images changed my reaction to them.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,597,602.0,And I'm sure that it happens between each other.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,599,605.0,I'll just share one of the mysteries here.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,602,606.0,This image is profoundly challenging to me.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,603,608.0,"Because the first time I exhibited it, four women, over"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,605,611.0,"the space of a weekend, came and shared stories in front of"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,611,616.0,"son, a father, a lover."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,613,619.0,The strange thing is this happened more than two dozen
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,616,623.0,times over the past 15 years.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,620,624.0,I can't explain it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,621,628.0,I can sweep it into that dustbin called coincidence.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,625,630.0,But I think it has something more to do with Jung's idea of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,627,631.0,synchronicity.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,628,634.0,"There's something happening in front of that, and I don't"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,631,636.0,know what that is.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,633,638.0,"In fact, I'm trying to figure it out and explore it a little"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,635,642.0,"more deeply and wondering, how can I get into that territory"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,639,644.0,where something more universal is shared?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,641,646.0,And how can I do work that's a little bit beyond me?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,643,649.0,Because that's where the areas of greatest growth are.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,646,653.0,I think sometimes not knowing is actually a benefit.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,650,655.0,"I remember being in another gallery show, doing the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,652,657.0,preview with the gallery director.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,654,658.0,He wanted to be able to tell stories about the

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,657,662.0,And I was only there for that weekend.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,659,664.0,And I came in front of this image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,661,666.0,And I couldn't remember whether I'd captured the snow
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,663,669.0,or whether I'd rendered it with Photoshop.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,666,671.0,And it got me to look at the image more closely.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,668,673.0,It got me to go and look at other photographs
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,670,675.0,of snow more closely.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,672,680.0,And it got me to go and look at snow more closely.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,677,684.0,"For not knowing, I became richer, because I'd looked"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,681,685.0,more carefully.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,682,689.0,And I think that photography can offer many opportunities
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,686,694.0,for that if we'll only accept an invitation.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,691,696.0,So there's one thing to stay up in this visual experience.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,693,700.0,"And a lot of times, that remains intuitive and vague."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,697,703.0,It's very often useful to follow it and put this into
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,700,706.0,"words, even if the words are just getting things going, to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,703,709.0,"have some sense of clarity of what happened, or what we're"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,706,713.0,"trying to accomplish, or what I might do next."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,710,717.0,"The first time I went to White Sands to photograph seriously,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,714,719.0,"I spent an evening and a morning,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,716,720.0,shot 24 rolls of film.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,717,722.0,"Yeah, this was back in the film days."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,719,724.0,I came way with two keepers.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,721,727.0,"I thought, OK, two keepers, not bad."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,724,732.0,"I mean, now many images do you really make that are really"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,729,736.0,"worth sharing, at least in a gallery context."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,733,739.0,About 1% is what most of my colleagues and I
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,736,740.0,have kind of agreed.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,737,741.0,And that doesn't mean you get to take your camera and put it
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,738,743.0,on motor drive and hope that one--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,740,746.0,kind of the spray and pray phenomena--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,743,750.0,doesn't work as well as being a little more considered
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,747,752.0,"looking at your first shot, figuring out how to improve"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,749,755.0,"it, looking at the successes and then how to do other"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,752,758.0,successes that might build on those successes and even get
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,755,761.0,out of certain grooves or out of certain ruts
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,758,763.0,and into a new groove.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,760,765.0,It's useful to be a little more considered.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,762,768.0,But I hadn't really figured out why I liked this image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,765,769.0,I hung it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,766,770.0,It wasn't quite as surreal as some of the impossible
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,767,774.0,symmetries or floating stones that I'm known for.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,771,775.0,It helped a lot--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,772,778.0,"well, it felt good-- when my father came in and patted me"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,775,779.0,on the back one morning.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,776,782.0,"Because I had put in my dining room, spent some time with it."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,779,784.0,"I think it's really useful to spend time with your images,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,781,787.0,one of the great things about prints.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,784,788.0,It's one thing to have them in hard drives.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,785,790.0,It's one thing to have them up on social networks.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,787,794.0,"But how often do we consider them casually, for a sustained"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,791,797.0,"time, a little more officially, like over time?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,794,801.0,You think a lot about how you interact with your images.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,798,803.0,"So Dad came in and said, that's a good one kid."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,800,805.0,You managed to avoid all the West Coast cliches.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,802,808.0,"I went, that feels good."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,805,809.0,That's great.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,806,811.0,But I still hadn't found what I was looking for.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,808,814.0,"Until my father-in-law, an engineer, came in and squinted"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,811,816.0,"and said, is that water?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,813,817.0,Got it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,814,818.0,I'm not photographing grains of sand.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,815,821.0,I'm photographing waves.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,818,823.0,"Now, I had to take his water and turn it into my wave,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,820,825.0,important to personalize the language.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,822,828.0,"But once I did that, I went back to the same scene,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,825,830.0,"photographed for the same amount of time, then came up"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,827,832.0,with a dozen keepers.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,829,834.0,Because I was focused along lines that
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,831,,were relevant to me.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,834,839.0,"my work, the idea of waves."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,836,841.0,These were just slower-moving waves.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,838,844.0,"Ironically, after that long, hot walk, I took shelter in"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,841,847.0,the shade of the park sign and started reading the literature
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,844,848.0,for the first time.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,845,850.0,These dunes move three feet a month.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,847,853.0,"It was there in front of me all along, you know."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,850,855.0,"And sometimes, I think artists get into--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,852,857.0,and we all get into--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,854,859.0,"modes where we sense things intuitively, where we put a"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,856,862.0,"lot of information together, both things that we have"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,859,864.0,"sensed mentally, physically, the other"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,861,865.0,things that we've read.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,862,866.0,We aggregate a lot of information.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,863,868.0,And it comes out in the things that we do.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,865,870.0,And it's one of the reasons I think it's so important not
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,867,872.0,just to think it but also to do it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,869,875.0,Because there's another kind of understanding that comes
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,872,878.0,from actually making something.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,875,881.0,There are a lot of other stories up on my website.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,878,886.0,"I want to shift gears here and talk about, in this case, how"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,883,888.0,tools can change perception.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,885,890.0,There's an awful lot of dialogue out there about the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,887,895.0,latest megapixel count or how many picoliters come off a
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,892,897.0,"printer, or what kind of fancy routines you can"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,894,899.0,do with your software.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,896,900.0,It's fun.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,897,902.0,"I mean, we live in an amazing time."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,899,905.0,More change to this medium of photography in the last 10
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,902,908.0,years than in its 175-year history.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,905,913.0,I remember years ago-- this was about 15 years ago--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,910,915.0,an analogy in Macworld.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,912,917.0,"If you took the Rolls-Royce and the personal computer,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,914,919.0,gave the same decrease in price and the same increase in
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,916,922.0,"performance, the Rolls-Royce would go seven times the speed"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,919,924.0,of sound and cost $0.70.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,921,926.0,"Of course, that's 15 years out of date, so I have absolutely"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,923,931.0,no idea what the new math is.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,928,933.0,Very interesting.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,930,937.0,"Have our ideas about what photography is, how we can"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,934,939.0,"practice it, not how we should--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,936,941.0,"remember, there's no cheating--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,938,943.0,"in the arts or in anything, really."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,940,945.0,It's really just a matter of misrepresentation.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,942,948.0,"If I put one of my surreal composites in Time magazine,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,945,952.0,I'm misrepresenting that it is that kind of photograph and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,949,954.0,belongs in that kind of context.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,951,956.0,There's nothing cheating about it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,953,958.0,I think we need to just do the work we need to do and then
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,955,961.0,start to make some interesting statements about what happened
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,958,963.0,"and decide, well, what kind of photography is it and what"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,960,965.0,uses can I put it to?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,962,968.0,"But none of this limiting, thou shalt not."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,965,970.0,Who wrote those commandments?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,967,971.0,Who gave them the right?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,968,975.0,We need to all give ourselves the right to rewrite that
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,972,978.0,"playbook and play our own games, the games that will"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,975,982.0,help us get where we want to go in our own authentic ways.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,979,986.0,"So it's great to have the training, not only of a"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,983,988.0,"painter, but also of a photographer."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,985,990.0,My dad's a well known fine art photographer.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,987,992.0,And he taught me what I know about black and white
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,989,993.0,photography.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,990,995.0,My mother also taught me about offset printing.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,992,996.0,And it was a great combination.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,993,999.0,"Because ink jet, digital cameras, it all came together."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,996,1002.0,"Plus, the compositing, some of the painting."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,999,1003.0,"She used to be a painter, as well."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1000,1006.0,So it was a good marriage of all of that knowledge base.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1003,1011.0,But I still have to overcome my curse of expertise.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1008,1013.0,I've been trained to do certain kinds of things in
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1010,,certain routines.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1012,1017.0,And one of the biggest challenges for me is to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1014,1021.0,"rethink what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, based on new"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1018,1022.0,possibilities.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1019,1027.0,"And with this blistering pace of change, we need to do this"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1024,1028.0,now more than ever.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1025,1030.0,"There are some pretty wonderful, wonderful"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1027,1031.0,opportunities.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1028,1034.0,So one of the big issues in photography is learning how to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1031,1037.0,"think within the frame, how to compose, those"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1034,1039.0,four essential lines.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1036,1041.0,"The four most important lines are the border, what's in,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1038,1044.0,"what's out, what visual dynamics you create."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1041,1048.0,What's the aspect ratio or proportion of that frame?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1045,1051.0,"But now, with stitching, we also need to learn how to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1048,1052.0,think outside the frame.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1049,1058.0,And it might not be creating a panoramic format like this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1055,1062.0,"Sometimes, it's just a matter of that extra inch, a little"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1059,1063.0,"the left, a little to the right, a little"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1060,1065.0,"up, a little down."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1062,1067.0,And I constantly have to catch myself and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1064,1068.0,develop a new habit.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1065,1071.0,"If I find that I'm eliminating, I would say, oh,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1068,1073.0,that's the old sacrifice I used to have to make.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1070,1078.0,And I'd just pull up or pull over to get the information.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1075,1080.0,"At the end of the day, all we really need to do is quote"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1077,1083.0,"Pee-wee Herman and say, I meant to do that."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1080,1086.0,"That's what my artistic intention was, like all of"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1083,1088.0,those art critics some of us went through.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1085,1092.0,What is your intention young man?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1089,,I don't know.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1091,1097.0,And so it's also useful to remember these panoramic
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1094,1102.0,formats are both vertical and horizontal.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1099,1105.0,"Or if you're David Hockney, they're all over the place--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1102,1108.0,a pretty interesting way of representing what to us is a
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1105,1111.0,"very dynamic, fluid--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1108,1113.0,first alarm.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1110,1115.0,I knew this was going to be fast--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1112,1119.0,"a very dynamic, fluid process of looking."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1116,1123.0,"Now, how do we represent that in a still frame?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1120,1127.0,So I'm not going to go through the Photoshop routine of just
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1124,,merging those two.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1125,1131.0,"Just to remind you, and remind myself, that there are"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1128,1132.0,multiple ways to merge it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1129,1135.0,And the way that I go through it will change different
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1132,1139.0,relationships within the image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1136,1145.0,"Now, I have the question, do I crop or do I clone?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1142,1148.0,"Well, it depends on what kind of photography"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1145,,I'm trying to make.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1150,1157.0,"If I clone in something like the top of this sky, it's just"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1154,1158.0,white texture.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1155,1159.0,Is that really cheating?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1156,1160.0,Is that really misrepresentation?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1157,1163.0,Should that no longer qualify as documentary?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1160,1166.0,I'm not sure it's really relevant.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1163,1175.0,"On the other hand, if I take a panoramic stitch like this--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1172,1177.0,"and I know certain distortions are involved in that, and"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1174,1179.0,we'll come back to that in just a second--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1176,1182.0,"I can then decide, do I crop, or do I clone?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1179,1183.0,How much do I crop or clone?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1180,1185.0,"If I decide to crop this much, because I want to make sure"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1182,1188.0,"that's there and I'm left over with this, am I willing to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1185,1189.0,clone that out?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1186,1194.0,If I do something like that-- and it's amazing how fluid
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1191,1196.0,that is today--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1193,1200.0,so if we do something like content over a film.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1197,1203.0,"And believe it or not, they've even got stuff on mobile"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1200,1206.0,platforms these days for this kind of technology that will
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1203,1208.0,sample other areas.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1205,1211.0,"Now, if somebody is looking at it from a geologic standpoint"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1222,1227.0,"making a fine art print, is it really relevant?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1224,1228.0,Does it matter?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1225,1229.0,Am I willing to aestheticize.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1226,1231.0,Depends on the type of image that I'm making.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1228,1237.0,"And often, I'll make multiple kinds of images presented in"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1234,1238.0,context with one another.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1235,1241.0,And the clues that I do or don't do something indicates
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1238,1244.0,what kind of photograph it is.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1241,1249.0,So what about taking an image like this and turning it into
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1246,1250.0,an image like that?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1247,1253.0,"Yes, of course, there are special effects added to that."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1250,1255.0,But look at the spatial relationships in that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1252,1260.0,"Now, lens profiles were designed to cure the side"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1257,1262.0,"effects of lenses, an interesting"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1259,1264.0,proposition right there.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1261,1268.0,"So the optical system introduces distortions, which"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1265,1270.0,are OK in journalistic contexts.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1267,1275.0,Or it's useful to identify those in forensic areas.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1272,1277.0,You need to know what was involved so you can
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1274,,interpret the data.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1278,1284.0,so we can understand what's been done and how this thing
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1281,1286.0,has been created.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1283,1292.0,But if I start to do something like arbitrarily change the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1289,1296.0,"spatial relationships, pulling the foreground forward,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1293,1299.0,"pushing the background back, making this feel longer."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1296,1302.0,It increases the sense of recession within the image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1299,1305.0,It compacts relationships here.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1302,1306.0,You can see this kind of thing in swings and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1303,1309.0,tilts with view cameras.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1306,1311.0,"Now, this is being able do it after the fact."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1308,1314.0,And one of the challenges here is to be able to think
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1311,1315.0,predictably in the field.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1312,1320.0,Should I change my angle of view?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1317,1322.0,Or shall I change some of those spatial
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1319,1324.0,relationships in post?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1321,1327.0,It's got me thinking about framing in a very different
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1324,1328.0,way than I used to.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1325,1332.0,And it's calling me to develop a new habit to explore the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1329,1335.0,"relative proportions, the spatial relationships between"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1332,1339.0,"objects in the frame, so that I can make them more powerful,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1336,1343.0,"make them more expressive, fine tune it, whether subtly"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1340,1344.0,or dramatically.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1341,1347.0,"Sometimes, just using this just a little bit produces a"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1344,1348.0,lot of change.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1345,1352.0,But it's a new habit that I think we all should be aware
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1349,1356.0,that it might benefit many of us to acquire.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1353,1358.0,This is not the way that I was trained to think about
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1355,1359.0,photography.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1356,1363.0,"And we just have to remember, it's not the same photography"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1360,1367.0,that it was so many years ago.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1364,1371.0,"For instance, will the real photograph still"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1368,1372.0,please stand up?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1369,1373.0,"OK, so it's a composite."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1370,1377.0,I guess none of them are a real photograph.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1374,1379.0,"Now, it's a different kind of photograph."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1376,1381.0,"OK, so let me rephrase the question."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1378,1383.0,See how important phrasing the question is?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1380,1387.0,Which Is the original aspect ratio or the aspect ratio that
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1384,1389.0,I finally landed on?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1386,1393.0,"I think, we'll all agree, that we have a different visual"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1390,1397.0,response to a horizontal panorama than we do to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1394,1400.0,"something that's horizontal, square,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1397,1402.0,"vertical, or vertical panorama."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1399,1405.0,"Now, we could do that very convincingly."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1402,1408.0,Let me show you.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1405,1412.0,So I'm just going to duplicate the layer here
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1409,1413.0,and transform it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1410,1414.0,"Child's play, right?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1411,1415.0,"Edit, transform."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1412,1418.0,We're just going to distort the frame.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1415,1421.0,"Past a certain point, you can see things"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1418,1423.0,get obviously distorted.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1420,1428.0,"And if you hadn't seen the original, would you know that"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1425,1431.0,something like that had been distorted?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1428,1433.0,Probably not.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1430,1435.0,"After all, you've been looking at a slightly distorted"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1432,1437.0,presentation this entire time.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1434,1438.0,[LAUGHTER]
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1435,1440.0,"JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: But do you see, there's more than one"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1437,1443.0,way to distort it?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1440,1447.0,If I came back in here and used content or a scale
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1444,1450.0,"similar to the content or a fill, is looking at the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1447,1453.0,smoother areas in the image and compressing them more--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1450,1454.0,look at the glacier.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1451,1456.0,Do you see the relationship between the mountain and the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1453,1459.0,"edge of the glacier and as that white, dead space in the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1456,1462.0,middle gets compacted--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1459,1465.0,see how much more forceful the image becomes?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1462,1469.0,"Now, let me distort them to the same amount, because I"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1466,1471.0,want an apples to apples comparison here
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1468,1474.0,or oranges to oranges.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1471,1477.0,So one has been distorted distorting the sky and the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1474,1480.0,smooth area of the snow more than the other.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1477,1483.0,And you see the different proportional relationships?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1480,1486.0,Certain areas have been distorted more than another.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1483,1490.0,"And of course, if I was willing to mask, I could"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1487,1496.0,"localize that distortion, as well,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1493,1499.0,bringing them closer together.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1496,1502.0,So this gets me thinking about framing in the field a little
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1499,,differently.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1502,1508.0,"bottom, left to right, I know I can squeeze 'em in and"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1505,1513.0,intensify that relationship between two significant things
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1510,1518.0,"in my frame, either by changing my angle of view."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1515,1521.0,And if there is a wall or a cliff or a body of water I
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1518,1526.0,"don't feel like getting into after, in post, or both."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1523,1528.0,See what this does to your brain?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1525,1529.0,"So that's the most important thing, what it"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1526,1530.0,does to your brain.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1527,1532.0,Because you start to see more possibilities out there.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1529,1534.0,You start to think more predictably.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1531,1536.0,"And that's what previsualization is about,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1533,1540.0,"being aware of what your tools are capable enough, to be able"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1537,1543.0,to get the material you need to get the final result you're
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1540,1544.0,looking for.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1541,1546.0,It doesn't mean there's not a process of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1543,1547.0,discovery along the way.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1544,1551.0,I'm not 100% certain that I want one form of distortion
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1548,1552.0,over the other.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1549,1555.0,But I've got enough material in my original captures to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1552,1557.0,allow me to explore both possibilities.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1554,1559.0,I can get where I want to go.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1556,1561.0,"And that's what we would like to do, be aware of the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1558,1564.0,"possibilities, photograph more versatility, make more of this"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1561,1569.0,"situation, and be able to enhance it further to create"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1566,1573.0,results what we stand behind 100%.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1570,1578.0,So I routinely play with things like how the frame is
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1575,1582.0,"divided, selectively distorting the image, fine"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1579,1585.0,tuning the proportion of it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1582,1586.0,They're very different visual statements.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1583,1589.0,"And I often like to play process of elimination, too"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1586,1594.0,"much space, too cramped, still too much space, still too"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1591,1597.0,"cramped, one or the other."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1594,1599.0,And this process of elimination helps a lot.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1596,1601.0,"And the other thing that's really important, to activate"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1598,1604.0,"all of your full visual intelligence, is to use"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1601,1608.0,interfaces that allow you to do side by side comparisons.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1605,1611.0,I could look at this thing one at a time and flip back and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1608,1612.0,forth between the other.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1609,1616.0,But I can't make those fast decisions when you look at
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1613,1619.0,both together.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1616,1621.0,Contextual seeing is really important.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1618,1623.0,It's one of the things that puzzles me most
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1620,1626.0,about iPads or tablets.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1623,1628.0,We're back to the Greek scroll.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1625,1632.0,"What happened to two pages, the image and text, or the new"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1629,1636.0,"book, web page and text, or a video."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1633,1637.0,You see where I'm going.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1634,1638.0,I did.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1635,1639.0,There's probably a technological limitation of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1636,1643.0,"putting two touch screens, you know, how much more"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1640,1644.0,it's going to cost.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1641,1648.0,"But to get away from that, side by side contextuality is"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1645,1651.0,a huge change in the interface.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1648,1654.0,And I think we need to think a lot about the design of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1651,1655.0,interfaces.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1652,1658.0,"There was one TED talk that I thought was brilliant, how it"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1655,1661.0,"was saying that in the 1900s, the dominant"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1658,1662.0,model was the novel.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1659,1667.0,"In the 20th century, it was the movie or film."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1664,1670.0,"And in the 21st century, it's now the interface."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1667,1673.0,That's an interesting statement.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1670,1676.0,So I start to have to think more predictably about things
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1673,1678.0,"like, well, the basic building blocks of"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1675,1680.0,"photography, time and light."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1677,1682.0,"I missed my top-selling shot, because I was still thinking"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1679,1686.0,in 125ths of a second the first time I went to try and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1683,1690.0,photograph Zabriskie Point in Death Valley.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1687,1692.0,"A friend of mine shook her finger at me and said, well,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1689,1693.0,I'll bet you could do it differently.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1690,1695.0,I think she was thinking I was going to create some
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1692,1699.0,"impossible symmetry, composite something unusual into it."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1696,1701.0,That's when the light bulb went off.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1698,1702.0,And I realized I had to go back.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1699,1704.0,It took me a year to get back.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1701,1707.0,"And, well, as I was standing there, photographing the same"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1704,1711.0,"composition over the space of 45 minutes, I was thinking,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1708,1714.0,"oh, no, I'm looking for dramatic light in every area"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1711,,of the image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1713,1720.0,I had to modify my plan when I finally got
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1717,1722.0,to putting it together.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1719,1723.0,But I had harvested.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1720,1726.0,I just held to my original plan enough to get enough
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1723,1731.0,information in enough shots to be able to recompose that
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1728,1732.0,"lighting situation, which doesn't exist at"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1729,1735.0,any 125th of a second.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1732,1738.0,"It's sunrise, 45 minutes later, 20"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1735,1740.0,minutes later after that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1737,1743.0,It's asking me to think more predictably about time and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1740,1746.0,"light, those basic building blocks of photography."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1743,1749.0,And it opens up possibilities like this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1746,1753.0,The same shots can be used to render entirely different
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1750,1755.0,versions of the same subject.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1752,1757.0,This kind of step being done routinely in product
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1754,1760.0,"photography, a little tougher in landscape photography."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1757,1762.0,"But if you've got passing clouds,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1759,1763.0,they're really your friends.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1760,1766.0,"Full open sunlight, edge of the clouds, beautiful diffused"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1763,1769.0,"light, cloud for shade."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1766,1772.0,"So really, I think, one of the things I like most about all"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1769,1775.0,of this is the way that it changes my mindset.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1772,1777.0,And I think mindset is everything.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1774,1779.0,It prepares you for so much.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1776,1784.0,"Like for draftsmen, for a compositor, to be able to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1781,1788.0,"think about putting pieces together, makes me think about"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1785,1790.0,shooting fragments.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1787,1794.0,"I remember a friend of mine, years ago, railing, you"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1793,1799.0,Everything is pieces.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1796,1803.0,So I had to figure out what I wanted to do with this and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1800,1806.0,"photograph a stone from half a dozen angles, all with the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1803,1808.0,"right lighting, to be able to get it to fit together."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1805,1812.0,"And I had to think about how light would create shadows,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1809,1815.0,would get distorted across the surface so they'd be harder
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1812,1818.0,"closer to the objects, softer further away, and that they do"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1815,,contain color.

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1824,1832.0,"and making a lot of notes, compositors, draftsmen,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1829,1834.0,painters have to spend a lot of time looking at the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1831,1837.0,richness of life in order to recreate it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1834,1841.0,"And a lot of times, this 125th of a second fast seeing"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1838,1843.0,doesn't get you to slow down and consider things a little
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1840,1844.0,more carefully.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1841,1846.0,And when you bump into having to do something like this
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1843,1849.0,"credibly, the more you start to get sensitive to that"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1846,1851.0,"stuff, the more credible your fictions become."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1848,1855.0,A lot of fun to think about just how you want to
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1852,1858.0,recompose an image.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1855,1860.0,It's so much fun to cheat.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1857,1862.0,"I mean, play."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1859,1865.0,"And, really, I do want to celebrate that playful spirit,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1862,1870.0,because it's in that play that a lot of discoveries happen.

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1871,1878.0,It's too wet to get out to those rocks that slide around
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1875,1880.0,and leave those mysterious tracks.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1877,1881.0,So you take the shots.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1878,1883.0,And you clone out the cracks and make your own tracks.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1880,1887.0,"Oh, you cheated."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1884,1891.0,"No, I invented."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1888,1895.0,"And it's also very interesting to ask, how many ways can you"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1897,1905.0,change the statement and/or bring something new to it?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,1902,1907.0,Interesting to think about bowls and paths.

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2065,2071.0,When did they forget?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2068,,It's wonderful.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2070,2075.0,It doesn't happen very often.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2072,2078.0,"And, in fact, when I go and ask kindergartners and grade"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2075,2081.0,"school students, particularly the younger they are, we get"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2078,2082.0,"an 80%, 90% response."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2079,2085.0,"And as they get older, sometime between the ages of 8"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2082,2086.0,"and 13 or 14, they start getting more self-conscious--"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2083,2088.0,fewer hands go up--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2085,2090.0,to the point where we get this adult
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2087,2091.0,syndrome of I can't draw.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2088,2093.0,"Maybe, I didn't phrase the question well enough."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2090,2095.0,"I didn't ask you, how many of you can draw like"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2092,2097.0,Michelangelo.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2094,2098.0,So maybe that's not your goal.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2095,2099.0,It takes a lot of training.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2096,2100.0,It takes a lot of time.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2097,2104.0,"I can draw like this, but I don't get the time to put 40"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2101,2108.0,"hours or 30 hours into a drawing, or even the 20 hours"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2105,2109.0,it takes to do something like this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2106,2113.0,I often don't find it's really that useful to put the one
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2110,2115.0,"hour that it takes to do something like this, 1 hour to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2112,2116.0,20 minutes.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2113,2118.0,"More often than not, I'm just sketching on my iPad,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2115,2123.0,"sketching ideas down, knocking 'em out in less than a minute."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2120,2126.0,It was a tiny little sketch that Edison handed his
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2123,2128.0,development team for the phonograph.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2125,2131.0,"It was this crawly little doodle that he said, here"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2128,2135.0,"we're going to make this, the phonograph."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2132,2136.0,Think how much that changed.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2133,2139.0,It wasn't a 40-page treatise.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2136,2140.0,And it didn't exist yet.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2137,2144.0,So how do you get ideas across that don't exist?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2141,2146.0,Drawing is a form of ideation.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2143,2148.0,And there are many ways to draw.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2145,2152.0,And we don't have to look for--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2149,2154.0,what are we even going to call it--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2151,2156.0,sophisticated ways of drawing?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2153,2157.0,I wouldn't even say that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2154,2159.0,Because I think you can do line drawings that are very
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2156,2161.0,"sophisticated, very simple things that have very"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2158,2163.0,sophisticated thought patterns behind them.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2160,2167.0,"We don't have to look for finished results, if that's"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2164,2169.0,not what we're ultimately going to produce.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2166,2172.0,But it can very definitely help enhance any of our
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2169,2174.0,creative efforts.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2171,2175.0,I know that it does for me.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2172,2179.0,"When I go into a situation, I often take inventory of an"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2176,,environment.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2178,2184.0,"It's a completely surreal, unusual environment."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2181,2185.0,And I'm taking stock.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2182,,I've got moon.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2183,2187.0,I've got clouds.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2184,2190.0,"I don't have any stars, because it's not dark enough."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2187,,I've got mountains.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2188,2192.0,I've got ocean.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2189,2193.0,How many other components?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2190,2195.0,I might have an island.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2192,2196.0,So I draw 'em out.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2193,2198.0,"Not the specific ones, but I draw a moon."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2195,2201.0,"It's a cloud, a mountain, an iceberg."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2198,2203.0,"Look, I'm just drawing icons that I can then reshuffle."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2200,2205.0,And what if I got 'em all aligned?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2202,2210.0,"What if they were nestled, that sense of being together,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2207,2213.0,"or cradled, scattered?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2210,2215.0,"I'm still looking for this one, the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2212,2216.0,reflection of a mountain.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2213,2220.0,"Antarctica, being the windiest continent, it's hard to get"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2217,2221.0,smooth reflections.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2218,2224.0,Maybe I'll have to composite this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2221,2225.0,But what I didn't realize when I was down
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2222,2226.0,there the first time--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2223,2228.0,"I ended up doing an editorial body of work, and it doesn't"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2225,2230.0,fit neatly into that body of work--
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2227,2234.0,I've had to reposition it into a separate body of work.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2231,2237.0,"And along the way, other ideas have come to light."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2234,2240.0,"The interesting thing is, when you draw out the combinations,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2237,2242.0,you're more likely to see them.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2239,2244.0,So these are some of the images that were produced
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2241,2246.0,along the way.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2243,2248.0,"They're not the specific compositions, but they're the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2245,2250.0,same kinds of patterns.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2247,2253.0,"You know how you rent or you buy a red car and, suddenly,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2250,2258.0,everybody's driving red cars.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2255,2261.0,You're sensitizing yourself to patterns.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2258,2264.0,And you can use the power of self-suggestion to be more
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2261,2266.0,aware of certain kinds of patterns and tell your
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2263,2269.0,subconscious that certain patterns are more important.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2266,2272.0,And there are a lot of ways of dealing with different
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2269,2274.0,"operations, which can help not only when you're compositing"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2271,2275.0,but also when you're out in the field.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2272,2278.0,How many significant variations can I find on the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2275,2281.0,theme of a tiny little mountain at the bottom of the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2278,2286.0,frame and a big sky?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2283,2287.0,"Apparently, there are a lot of variations."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2284,2290.0,And I continue to look for more.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2287,2291.0,"Now, this has become part of my repertoire."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2288,2293.0,It's a pattern that I'm constantly looking for.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2290,2296.0,We all develop a familiarity with
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2293,2297.0,certain kinds of patterns.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2294,2299.0,It's kind of our groove.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2296,2300.0,Because we can see them very quickly.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2297,2302.0,And we can get more successful images that way.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2299,2304.0,We start to understand 'em better.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2301,2306.0,We learn how to make those stronger.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2303,2308.0,We practice.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2305,2309.0,Practice makes better.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2306,2311.0,Forget about perfect.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2308,2313.0,And some patterns won't come as easily.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2310,2315.0,But if you can identify the pattern and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2312,2317.0,"practice, it's easier."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2314,2318.0,Strange thing.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2315,2321.0,"If you write something down, you're 72% more likely to take"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2318,2322.0,action on it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2319,2324.0,"So if you sketch something out, I'm not sure what the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2321,2328.0,"percentage is, but you're far more likely to recognize that"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2325,2330.0,"pattern, to learn new patterns."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2327,2332.0,"See, it's all about pattern recognition."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2329,2334.0,It's about recognizing the pattern.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2331,2338.0,"And it's also about creating patterns, as well."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2335,2342.0,I want to leave on a note that I think is very important.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2339,2346.0,It's very hard to be spontaneous in any arena that
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2343,2350.0,we have a high degree of expertise in.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2347,2356.0,"To play, to be spontaneous in that, is challenging."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2353,2358.0,It's one of the reasons I love cell photography.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2355,2362.0,I challenge myself to take on a number of experiments and
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2359,2364.0,"photograph things I normally wouldn't photograph, things"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2361,2366.0,that don't reinforce my brand.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2363,2367.0,This is just for play.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2364,2369.0,I have no idea what I'm going to use them for.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2366,2370.0,I'm simply enjoying looking.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2367,2372.0,But I'm challenging myself to try and look
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2369,2374.0,in different ways.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2371,2377.0,This is a selection of images that all have
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2374,2378.0,this painterly look.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2375,2380.0,And I'm wondering if it's the frustrated painter in me
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2377,2381.0,coming out.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2378,2385.0,"Or is it a desire to look more broadly, to not get hung up on"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2382,2389.0,"the details, to have a more spontaneous quality to it."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2386,2390.0,I'm not sure.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2387,2392.0,I'm still figuring that out as I continue.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2389,2394.0,I do know that sometimes they plant the
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2391,2396.0,seeds for other things.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2393,2398.0,"Most the time, it's just visual play."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2395,2400.0,It keeps me sharp.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2397,2401.0,I enjoy it.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2398,2402.0,It's fun to communicate with people.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2399,2404.0,"Once in a while, I'll find a seed that might be worth"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2401,2408.0,"developing, a shot that I made a couple years ago at Point"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2405,2410.0,Lobos with my iPhone.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2407,2411.0,And I've set something in motion.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2408,2414.0,Because I have returned here this spring and shot with my
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2411,2418.0,DSLR in a very focused way and was able to be very productive
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2415,2421.0,in three short sessions and bring a certain kind of
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2418,2424.0,"intensity and understanding, because I'd done some of the"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2421,2426.0,visual research.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2423,2428.0,"I strongly recommend that you allow yourself to play, not"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2425,2432.0,"only to rekindle that creative process, that spirit."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2429,2434.0,"Because we get involved in creative lives, because it"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2431,2436.0,reinvigorates us.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2433,2437.0,It refreshes us in so many ways.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2434,2439.0,It not only freshens our perspective.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2436,2441.0,It puts energy into our system.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2438,2444.0,It keeps our minds stimulated in interesting ways.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2441,2447.0,"But along the way, we often discover some things that are"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2444,2450.0,"personally relevant, that are resonant within us."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2447,2453.0,Sometimes it surprises us what we discover.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2450,2456.0,"And I think it's important to give ourselves permission,"

ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2455,2463.0,"results-oriented, to be a little more authentic."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2460,2466.0,"We go some places we never expected to go, because that's"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2463,2468.0,part of the process of discovery.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2465,2471.0,I think photography is just one component in
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2468,2472.0,a process of discovery.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2469,2476.0,It may be the area that I have a degree of expertise in.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2473,2480.0,It might be what I do professionally.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2477,2484.0,But I have to watch my curse of expertise and remind myself
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2481,2488.0,"to rekindle that little kid who could draw, that little"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2485,2490.0,kid who could.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2487,2493.0,"Picasso said, it takes a long time to grow young."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2490,2496.0,I don't think so.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2493,2497.0,We were kids once.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2494,2498.0,We could all draw.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2495,2500.0,We were all spontaneous.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2497,2502.0,You ever met a kid who's not creative?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2499,2506.0,"You ever met a kid who doesn't ruthlessly, mercilessly push"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2503,,the envelope?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2505,2510.0,Does that still apply today?
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2507,2511.0,Let me test that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2508,2513.0,"They reconfirm, right?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2510,2515.0,"They're natural-born scientists, you know."
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2512,2520.0,"Theory, test, reconfirm, all right?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2517,2521.0,Endlessly inquisitive.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2518,2524.0,"And, I think, if we can rekindle that spirit and allow"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2521,2529.0,"ourselves to move into modes that are less focused, we"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2526,2531.0,might discover more.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2528,2533.0,Part of the issue is being able to get
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2530,2534.0,outside of our box.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2531,2537.0,The thing that is really neat is that we can adopt many
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2534,2541.0,"different boxes, create boxes of our own creating, switch"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2538,2542.0,out the box.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2539,2544.0,"I mean, in order to think outside the box, you first"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2541,2546.0,"have a box, right?"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2543,2549.0,But you don't have to play with one box your entire life.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2546,2550.0,And you can mix and match.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2547,2554.0,And it can be very inspiring to do that.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2551,2560.0,So I encourage you to engage in those ideas and allow
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2557,2563.0,"yourself a little time to find out what your photography is,"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2560,2566.0,certainly to be aware of what the new possibilities are.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2563,2570.0,Because they're very expansive.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2567,2573.0,We have this embarrassment of riches today.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2570,2574.0,"And rather than doing everything, I think we have to"
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2571,2576.0,make some choices as to what's most relevant for us.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2573,2580.0,But a little bit of exposure to what's possible out there
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2577,2582.0,will help you make better choices along the way.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2579,2586.0,And it's certainly stimulating and a lot of fun.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2583,2587.0,Thank you for coming today.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2584,2590.0,And I'd be happy to answer questions after this.
ptX6QwRjAIo,The Creative Process | John Paul Caponigro | Talks at Google,2587,2593.0,I wish you good photography or a visual life.

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),-1,6.0,(beeping)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),3,7.0,- Can you understand that?
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),4,8.0,'Cause I can't.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),5,10.0,But we're gonna learn how to do it together.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),7,12.0,"I'm gonna teach you how to memorize,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),9,15.0,or learn Morse code in this video.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),12,16.0,Let's do it.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),13,17.0,(snapping)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),14,25.0,(light guitar music)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),22,29.0,"So, the story goes that Samuel Morse was away from his wife,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),26,31.0,and got a letter saying that she was very sick.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),28,34.0,"He immediately went home, which took him a lot of time,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),31,35.0,"and by the time he got home,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),32,38.0,"he found out that she had actually already passed away,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),35,39.0,and was even buried.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),36,40.0,Can you imagine?
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),37,41.0,"So, he became dead set"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),38,45.0,"on how to make communication a lot quicker,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),42,47.0,and subsequently came up with Morse code.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),44,48.0,(energetic music)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),45,50.0,- [Mario] Here we go!
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),47,52.0,- What we're gonna do in this video is figure out
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),49,54.0,how to get it in our heads.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),51,55.0,"I'm gonna teach you two ways,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),52,57.0,and I'm gonna learn it at the same time.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),54,60.0,One way is just kinda the quick and dirty way.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),57,61.0,"It's not gonna take you very much time,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),58,62.0,and what it'll do
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),59,63.0,"is it'll put enough information in your head,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),60,65.0,"so that you, along with a piece of paper"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),62,68.0,"can write out basically the Morse code chart,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),65,69.0,"and from there,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),66,71.0,"you could listen to Morse code, or write it,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),68,73.0,so you would have the chart in your head.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),70,75.0,"Now, that's great for that specific purpose,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),72,77.0,"but if you heard Morse code randomly in a restaurant,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),74,79.0,"or an airplane, or wherever you are,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),76,81.0,"you would have to quickly jot out this chart,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),78,82.0,and figure it out.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),79,83.0,Chances are you probably can't do that.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),80,86.0,"So, the second version of memorizing Morse code"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),83,88.0,will be how to actually memorize
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),85,91.0,"what the sounds are for each letter,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),88,93.0,"so that if you ever hear Morse code,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),90,94.0,"beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),91,98.0,"you can actually translate it as it's happening to you,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),95,99.0,which would be pretty cool.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),96,101.0,(light guitar music)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),98,102.0,"So, the very basics of Morse code"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),99,105.0,is that it's made up of dots and dashes.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),102,108.0,"Dot,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),105,109.0,and a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),106,111.0,"Now, different combinations of the dots and the dashes"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),108,113.0,"will produce different letters,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),110,115.0,and then different combinations of those letters
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),112,118.0,will obviously create words.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),115,120.0,"And then, a combination of words will create sentences,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),117,123.0,a combination of sentences will create paragraphs.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),120,125.0,"When you're beeping out each letter,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),122,127.0,"dots take up one beat,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),124,130.0,and then dashes take up three of those beats.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),127,131.0,"Now, the reason that tempo matters"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),128,133.0,"is because obviously, when you get two different words,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),130,136.0,you want to have some kind of spacing between it.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),133,138.0,A space between two letters in a word
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),135,141.0,"would be three lengths, or three beats,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),138,144.0,"and then between words would be seven, okay?"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),141,146.0,"So, that way you can build words,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),143,148.0,"and you know where one letter starts,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),145,150.0,"one word starts, et cetera."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),147,151.0,We won't worry about that for now.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),148,154.0,Let's get to the basics of how to memorize
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),151,156.0,"the simplest form of the Morse code,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),153,161.0,"so that you can write it out, and then do it by ear."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),158,163.0,(thudding)
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),160,165.0,"All right, so our first thing that we're gonna do"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),162,168.0,"is we're gonna learn some really weird story,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),165,170.0,and it goes like this.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),167,172.0,"I want you to picture that there is an E.T.,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),169,175.0,"an extra terrestrial, and his name happens to be Ian."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),172,176.0,"- [Man] Hey, Ian!"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),173,177.0,- I-A-N.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),174,178.0,That's his name.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),175,180.0,"It's just a regular name, Ian."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),177,182.0,"And Ian, suddenly, he's very open minded,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),179,184.0,"he says, ""Mm, sure."""
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),181,187.0,"And what's gonna happen is he gets some WD-40,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),184,189.0,"and before he does something with it,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),186,192.0,"he says to himself out loud, ""Kay, go."""
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),189,193.0,"Like, okay, I'm ready, go."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),190,194.0,"For some reason,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),191,198.0,he uses that oil to turn on some high voltage frequency.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),195,199.0,"I don't know what that means,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),196,202.0,"but just imagine that somehow with the WD-40,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),199,204.0,he has some high voltage frequency
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),201,206.0,suddenly coursing through his veins.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),203,210.0,"He pauses for a second, and says to himself, ""L-O-L."""
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),207,212.0,"It was a funny experience as an extra terrestrial, whatever."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),209,215.0,"Once that's all done, he puts on his PJs,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),212,218.0,"gets ready for bed, gets inside of a box,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),215,220.0,"'cause that's where apparently E.T.s sleep,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),217,223.0,"and the box happens to be size Q,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),220,225.0,'cause Q is the size of all boxes

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),224,228.0,- Duh.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),225,229.0,- That's it.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),226,233.0,"So what we've actually memorized there is just the alphabet,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),230,234.0,"in a certain order,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),231,236.0,"their frequency in the English language, more or less."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),233,238.0,"It's actually not quite correct, but it's close enough."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),235,242.0,"So, if we write out what we have,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),239,245.0,"we have E, T, right, E.T.?"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),242,247.0,His name was Ian.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),244,248.0,Right?
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),245,253.0,"Then, he said, ""Mm, sure."""

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),281,286.0,The way it works is actually there's a binary tree
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),283,287.0,that can be drawn.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),284,290.0,"If I have my letters here, you start at the top,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),287,292.0,"I'll put a little circle here,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),289,294.0,"that's where you start, and you branch out."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),291,296.0,"At very node, you branch out."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),293,297.0,"So, to the left, and to the right,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),294,299.0,"I'm gonna read from left to right,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),296,301.0,the alphabet that I just wrote down here.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),298,305.0,"So, the first one would be E, then T."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),302,307.0,And those happen to be the most frequent letters
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),304,308.0,in the English alphabet.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),305,310.0,"Then, we branch each of those down,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),307,313.0,"further into two,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),310,316.0,"and my next two letters are I and A,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),313,318.0,and then we have N and M.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),315,320.0,Just going across from left to right.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),317,323.0,"We continue down, breaking those into further things."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),320,324.0,"I'm running out of room here,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),321,326.0,but I'll show you the actual chart in a little bit.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),323,334.0,"So, after M was S, U, R, W, D, K, G, O,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),331,335.0,"and so on, and so on."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),332,337.0,I'll let you guys finish that.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),334,338.0,"I'll show the graphic in a second,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),335,339.0,so you can follow along completely.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),336,342.0,"So, if you go down the branches to the left, that's a dot,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),339,345.0,and going right down the branch is a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),342,348.0,And you can literally read out which letter is
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),345,350.0,"if you follow this track, and say to yourself,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),347,351.0,"okay, if I'm going left, that's a dot,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),348,352.0,"if I'm going right, that's a dash,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),349,354.0,and then you just compile them all together
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),351,355.0,to create the letter.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),352,358.0,"If I go to the left for the E, that's just a dot,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),355,361.0,"and that is the Morse code for E, a dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),358,363.0,"And then, if I go to the right for T,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),360,364.0,it's a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),361,366.0,"Now, let's say we wanna get to S."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),363,367.0,"Now, what am I gonna do?"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),364,368.0,"I'm gonna follow my branches here,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),365,370.0,"I go down to E, that's a dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),367,372.0,"I go down to I, that's another left move,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),369,373.0,that's another dot.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),370,376.0,"And then, I go another left branch move, that's another dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),373,379.0,"So, S happens to be dot, dot, dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),376,380.0,Let's say I wanna go to O.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),377,383.0,"I would go down to T, that's a dash."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),380,384.0,"Okay, so I have a dash so far."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),381,385.0,I go down to M.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),382,387.0,"Again that's to the right, that's another dash,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),384,388.0,"and then I go to O, that's another dash."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),385,391.0,"So, O is actually dash, dash, dash."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),388,394.0,"So, now if we look at this chart,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),391,395.0,"there's one more layer, I didn't draw it out here,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),392,396.0,but you can see it in the chart.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),393,399.0,"You see H, V, F, from the left most,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),396,400.0,and then there's a space.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),397,402.0,"Remember, I told you there was a space?"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),399,405.0,The L sits there alone as the left part of R.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),402,408.0,"Then, we have P, J, B, X, C, Y, Z, Q."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),405,409.0,"It just goes all the way across,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),406,411.0,"and then of course, the last two under two,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),408,412.0,there's no more letters of the alphabet.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),409,415.0,"But let's say we wanna figure out what B is, right?"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),412,416.0,Which is pretty deep down the tree.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),413,419.0,"So, I go to the right to get to T."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),416,420.0,That's a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),417,423.0,"I go to the left to get to N, that's a dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),420,425.0,"I see that I have to go down to D and B,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),422,426.0,which are both dots.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),423,429.0,"So, B is actually dash, dot, dot, dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),426,432.0,Cool.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),429,433.0,"So, the next step,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),430,436.0,we're gonna memorize what each letter actually sounds like.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),433,438.0,People who are very proficient in Morse code
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),435,440.0,have suggested that you should not learn
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),437,442.0,what it looks like as a pneumonic.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),439,444.0,"'Cause my first instinct was okay,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),441,445.0,"maybe I'll think of,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),442,447.0,"I'll look at what each letter looks like,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),444,449.0,"as dots and dashes, and I'll think of a picture,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),446,450.0,something that it looks like.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),447,451.0,"But apparently, that's really tough,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),448,452.0,"and once you learn it that way,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),449,455.0,it's actually hard to translate it to audio.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),452,456.0,"So, the suggestions I've read"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),453,459.0,"are to turn it immediately into some sound,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),456,461.0,and then that will always help you remember
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),458,462.0,"when you hear the sound,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),459,465.0,which is ultimately what you wanna be able to do.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),462,467.0,"For the way this works is for every letter in the alphabet,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),464,470.0,we're basically gonna have a little phrase
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),467,473.0,that has some kind of stress on syllables
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),470,475.0,that will help you remember a dot versus a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),472,477.0,"Remember, a dot is very quick,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),474,481.0,"and a dash is a bit longer, more stressed upon."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),478,483.0,"So, the word that we're gonna come up with, or the phrase,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),480,484.0,it's gonna have a similar structure
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),481,487.0,as the dots and dashes of the actual letter itself.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),484,490.0,"So, let's start with our first example here, the letter A."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),487,492.0,"Now, if I just remember the word apart,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),489,494.0,the way I stress it in my head is apart.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),491,497.0,"The a is short, the part is long."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),494,500.0,We have a dot and a dash.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),497,501.0,"Uh, part."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),498,503.0,And some of these are totally weird.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),500,505.0,"Hopefully, they're weird enough that you can remember them."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),502,508.0,"So, B is gonna be Bob is the man."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),505,510.0,Bob is the man.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),507,511.0,Bob is the man.

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),509,516.0,"Bob is the man is dash, dot, dot, dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),513,521.0,Bob is the man.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),518,522.0,"Now, it's important when you learn these,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),519,525.0,"as I'm saying them, is to hear them as I stress them,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),522,526.0,'cause that's gonna help you remember them.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),523,528.0,Bob is the man.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),525,529.0,Bob is the man.

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),529,533.0,Let's roll onto C.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),530,534.0,This one's easy.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),531,535.0,"I just think of Coca-Cola,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),532,537.0,but I pronounce it like this.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),534,538.0,Coca-Cola.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),535,540.0,Coca-Cola.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),537,545.0,"The way Morse code is for C is dash, dot, dash, dot."
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),542,548.0,D is dog did it.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),545,549.0,Dog did it.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),546,551.0,"The dog did it, right?"

D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),559,563.0,"You can spend your time learning those,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),560,567.0,and practicing vocalizing it with those stressed syllables.
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),564,569.0,"So, you know what it's supposed to sound like,"
D8tPkb98Fkk,LEARN MORSE CODE from a MEMORY CHAMP (in 15 minutes),566,571.0,what it will be like in dots and dashes.
