4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
imagine that men are from mars and women are from venus

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
one day long ago the martians looking through their telescopes discovered the

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
venusians just glimpsing the venusians awakened

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
feelings they had never known they fell in love and quickly invented

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
space travel and flew to venus the venusians welcomed the martians with

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
open arms the love between the venusians and

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
martians was magical they delighted in being together doing

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
things together and sharing together though from different worlds they

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
reveled in their differences they spent months learning about each

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
other exploring and appreciating their different needs preferences

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and even behavior patterns for years they lived together in love and harmony

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
then they decided to fly to earth in the beginning everything was

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
wonderful and beautiful but the effects of earth's atmosphere

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
took hold and one morning

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
everyone woke up with a peculiar kind of amnesia

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
selective amnesia both the martians and venusians forgot

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that they were from different planets and were supposed to be different

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and one morning everything they had learned about their

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
differences was erased from their memory and since that day

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
men and women have been in conflict without the awareness that we're

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
supposed to be different men and women are at odds with each

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
other we mistakenly assume that if our

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
partners love us they will react and behave in certain

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ways the way we react when we love someone

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
men mistakenly expect women to think communicate

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and react the way men do women mistakenly expect men to feel and

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
communicate and respond the way women do we've forgotten that men and women are

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
supposed to be different as a result our relationships are filled

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
with unnecessary friction and conflict clearly recognizing and respecting these

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
differences dramatically reduces confusion when

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
dealing with the opposite sex when you remember that men are from mars

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and women are from venus everything can be explained

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
falling in love is always magical it feels eternal

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we naively believe that somehow we are exempt from the problems our parents had

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
free from the odds that love will die assured that it's meant to be and we are

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
destined to live forever happily ever after

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but as the magic recedes and daily life

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
takes over it emerges that men continue to expect

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
women to think and react like men and women expect men to feel and behave

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
like women we don't take the time to understand and

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
respect each other we become demanding resentful

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
judgmental and intolerant

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
we ask ourselves how does it happen

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
why does it happen why does it happen to us

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
to answer these questions our greatest minds have developed brilliant and

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
complex philosophical and psychological models

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
yet still the old patterns return and love dies

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
it happens to almost everyone very few people indeed are able to grow

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and love yet it does happen

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
when men and women are able to respect and accept their differences

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
then love has a chance to blossom through understanding the hidden

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
differences of the opposite sex we can more successfully give and

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
receive the love that's in our hearts by validating and accepting our

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
differences creative solutions can be discovered

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
whereby we can succeed in getting what we want

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and more important we can learn how to best love and

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
support the people we care about love is magical and it can last

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if we remember our differences

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that men don't

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
listen either a man completely ignores her when she speaks

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
or he listens for a few beats assesses what's bothering her and then

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
he proudly puts on his mr fix-it hat and offers her a solution to make her feel

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
better no matter how many times she tells him

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that he's not listening he doesn't get it and he keeps doing the

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
same thing she wants empathy

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
he thinks she wants solutions

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the most frequently expressed complaint men have about women

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is that women are always trying to change them

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
when a woman loves a man she feels responsible to assist him in growing and

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
tries to help him improve the way he does things

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
she forms the home improvement committee and he becomes her primary focus

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
no matter how much he resists her help she persists

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
waiting for an opportunity to help him or to tell him what to do

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
she thinks she's nurturing him while he feels he's being controlled

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
instead he wants her acceptance these two problems can finally be solved

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
by first understanding why men offer solutions and why women seek to improve

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
let's pretend to go back in time and observe life on mars and venus

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
before the planets discovered one another and came to earth

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
we can gain some insights into men and women

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
martians value power competency efficiency and achievement

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
their sense of self is defined through their ability to achieve results

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
they experience fulfillment primarily through success and accomplishments

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
achieving goals is very important to a martian

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
because it's the way for him to prove his competence

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and thus feel good about himself and for him to feel good about himself

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
he must achieve these goals alone by himself

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
autonomy is a symbol of efficiency power and competence

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
understanding this martian characteristic can help women to

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
understand why men resist so much being corrected

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
or being told what to do to offer a man unsolicited advice

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is to presume that he doesn't know what to do or that he can't do it on his own

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
men are very touchy about this because the issue of competence is so

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
very important to them because he's handling his problems on

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
his own a martian rarely talks about his

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
problems unless he needs expert advice asking for help when you can do it

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
yourself is perceived as a sign of weakness

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
however if he truly does need help

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
then it's a sign of wisdom to get it in this case he'll find someone he

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
respects and then talk about his problem talking about a problem on mars is an

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
invitation for advice another martian feels honored by the opportunity

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
automatically he puts on his mr fixit hat

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
listens for a few beats and then offers some jewels of advice

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
this martian custom is one of the reasons

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
men instinctively offer solutions when a woman talks about her feelings or about

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
her problems when a woman innocently shares upset

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
feelings or explores out loud the problems of her day a man mistakenly

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
assumes she's looking for some expert advice

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
he proudly puts on his mr fix-it hat and begins giving advice

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
this is his way of trying to help and of showing love

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
once he's offered a solution however and she continues to be upset

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
it becomes increasingly difficult for him to listen because his solutions

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
being rejected he feels useless

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
he has no idea that by just listening with empathy and interest he can be

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
supportive he does not know that on venus talking

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
about problems is not an invitation to offer a solution

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
venusians have different values their sense of self is defined through

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
their feelings and the quality of their relationships and their communication

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
they experience fulfillment through sharing and relating

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
communication is of primary importance to share their personal feelings is much

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
more important than achieving goals or success

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
talking and relating to one another is a source of tremendous fulfillment

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
this fulfillment is hard for a man to comprehend

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
he can come close to understanding a woman's experience of sharing and

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
relating by comparing it to the satisfaction he

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
feels when he wins a race achieves a goal or solves a problem

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
instead of being goal oriented women are relationship oriented

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
they are more concerned with expressing their goodness their love their caring

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
venusians are very intuitive they pride themselves on being

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
considerate of the needs and feelings of others

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a sign of great love is to offer help and assistance to another venusian

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
without even being asked because proving one's competence is not

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
as important to a venusian offering help is not offensive

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and needing help is not a sign of weakness

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
a man however may feel offended when a woman offers advice

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
because he doesn't feel she trusts his ability to do it himself

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
a woman has no conception of this male sensitivity because for her

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
it's another feather in her hat if someone offers to help her it makes her

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
feel loved and cherished but offering help to a man can make him

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
feel incompetent weak or even unloved when a woman tries to improve a man he

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
feels she's trying to fix him she's trying to change him

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
he receives the message that he's broken

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
she doesn't realize her caring attempts to help

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
may actually humiliate him she mistakenly thinks she's just helping him

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to grow without this insight into the nature of

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
men it's very easy for a woman to

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
unknowingly and unintentionally hurt and offend the man she loves most

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
for example tom and mary were going to a party tom

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
was driving after about 20 minutes

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and going around the same block a few times

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
it was clear to mary that tom was lost she finally suggested that he call for

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
help tom became very silent

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
they eventually arrived at the party but the tension from that moment

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
persisted the whole evening mary had no idea of why tom was so upset

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
from her side she was just saying i love and care about you so i'm

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
offering this help from his side he was offended

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what he heard was i don't trust you to get us there

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you are incompetent without knowing about life on mars

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
mary couldn't appreciate how important it was for tom to accomplish his goal

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
without help offering advice was the ultimate insult

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
after hearing about martians and venusians

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
mary learned how to support tom at such difficult times

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the next time he was lost instead of offering help

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
she restrained herself from offering any advice

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
she took a deep relaxing breath and appreciated in her heart what tom

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
was trying to do for her tom greatly appreciated her warmth and

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
trust the evening was a great success

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
generally speaking when a woman offers unsolicited advice or tries to help a

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
man she has no idea of how critical and

172
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
unloving she may sound to him even though her intent is loving

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
her suggestions do offend and sometimes hurt

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
his reactions may be strong especially if he felt criticized as a child or he

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
experienced his father being criticized by his mother

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
for many men it's important to prove that they can get to their goal

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
even if it's a small thing like driving to a restaurant or to a party

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
ironically he may be more sensitive about the little things than the big his

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
feelings are like this if i can't be trusted to do the small

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
things like getting us to a party how can she trust me to do the bigger things

181
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
like their martian and sisters men pride themselves on being experts especially

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
when it comes to fixing mechanical things getting places or solving

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
problems these are the times when he needs her

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
loving acceptance the most and not her advice or criticism

185
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
likewise if a man doesn't understand how a woman is different

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
he can make things worse when he's actually trying to help

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
men need to remember that women talk about problems to get close and not

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
necessarily to get solutions so many times a woman just wants to

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
share her feelings about her day and her husband thinking he's helping

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
interrupts her by offering a steady flow of solutions to her problems

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
for example mary comes home from an exhausting day

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
she wants and needs to share her feelings about the day she says

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
there's so much to do i don't have any time for myself

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
tom says you should quit that job you don't have

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to work so hard find something you like to do

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
mary says but i like my job

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
they just expect me to change everything at a moment's notice

198
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
tom says don't listen to him

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
just do what you can do mary says i am

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
i can't believe i completely forgot to call my aunt today

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
tom says don't worry about it she'll understand

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
mary says do you know what she's going through

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
she needs me tom says

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you worry too much that's why you're so unhappy

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
mary angrily says i'm not always unhappy can't you just

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
listen to me tom says i am listening

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
mary says why do i even bother after this conversation mary was more

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
frustrated than when she arrived home seeking intimacy and companionship

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
tom was also frustrated and had no idea what went wrong

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he wanted to help but his problem-solving tactics didn't work

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
without knowing about life on venus tom didn't understand how important it

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
was just to listen without offering solutions

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
his solutions only made things worse you see venusians never offer solutions

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
when someone's talking about their feelings

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
when tom heard about the venusians and how much they needed to talk

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
he gradually learned how to listen when mary now comes home tired or

217
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
exhausted their conversations are quite different they sound like this

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
mary says there's so much to do i have no time for

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
me tom takes a deep breath relaxes on the

220
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
exhale and says

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
hmm sounds like you had a hard day

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
mary says they expect me to change everything at a

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
moment's notice i don't know what to do

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
tom pauses and then says hmm

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
[Music] mary says i even forgot to call my aunt

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
tom says with a slightly wrinkled brow oh no

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
mary says she needs me so much now i feel so bad

228
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
tom says you're such a loving person come here let me give you a hug

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
tom gives mary a hug and she relaxes in his arms with a sire relief

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
she then says i love talking with you

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
you make me really happy and as they finish the hug

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
she says thanks for listening i feel much better

233
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
not only mary but also tom felt better he was amazed at how much happier his

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
wife was when he finally learned to listen

235
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
not everything is wrong with mr fixit or the home improvement committee these are

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
very positive martian and venusian attributes

237
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the mistakes are only in timing and approach

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
men need to remember that when women seem upset and talk about their problems

239
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
it's not the time to offer solutions women need to remember that unsolicited

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
advice or criticism especially if he's just made a mistake

241
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
makes him feel unloved and controlled to learn from his mistakes he needs to

242
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
feel her acceptance more than her advice when a man feels that a woman is not

243
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
trying to improve him he's much more likely to ask for her feedback and

244
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
advice if you're a woman i suggest for the next

245
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
week practice restraining from giving any

246
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
unsolicited advice or criticism the men in your life will not only

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
appreciate it but also will be much more attentive to your needs and responsive

248
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
if you're a man i suggest that for the next week you

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
practice listening whenever a woman speaks

250
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
with the sole intention of respectfully understanding what she's going through

251
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
practice biting your tongue whenever you get the urge to offer a solution

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
or change how she's feeling you'll be surprised when you experience

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
how much she appreciates you

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
one of the biggest differences between men and women is how they cope with

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
stress men become increasingly focused and

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
withdrawn while women become increasingly

257
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
overwhelmed and emotionally involved at these times a man's needs for feeling

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
good are different from a woman's he feels better by solving problems

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
while she feels better by talking about problems

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
not understanding and accepting these differences creates unnecessary friction

261
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in our relationships here's a common example when tom comes

262
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
home he wants to relax and unwind by quietly reading the news

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
he is stressed by the unsolved problems of his day and finds relief through

264
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
forgetting about them his wife mary also wants to relax from her stressful day

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
she however wants to find relief by talking about the problems of her day

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the tension slowly building between them gradually becomes resentment

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
tom secretly thinks mary talks too much while mary feels ignored

268
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
without understanding their differences they will grow further apart

269
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
problem can be resolved first by understanding in greater detail

270
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
how men and women cope with stress let's again observe life on mars and

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
venus and glean some insights about men and women

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
when a martian gets upset he never talks about what's bothering

273
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
him instead he becomes very quiet and goes to his private cave to think

274
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
about his problem mulling it over to find a solution

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
when he has found the solution he feels much better and comes out of his cave

276
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
if he can't find a solution then he needs to do something to forget

277
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
his problems like reading a magazine or playing a game

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
this is hard for women to understand because on venus

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
sharing your problems with another is an important activity and it's actually

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
considered a sign of love and trust when a man is stressed he will withdraw

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
into the cave of his mind and focus on solving a problem

282
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
at such times he is powerless to give his partner the attention

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and communication she needs and deserves it's hard for her to be accepting of him

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
at these times because she doesn't know how stressed he

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is if he were to come home and talk about

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
his problems then she could be more compassionate

287
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
but when a man is stuck in his cave a woman resents his not being more open

288
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
she feels hurt when he turns on the news or goes outside to play some basketball

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and ignores her it's easy to take it personally

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
to expect a man who's in his cave instantly to become open responsive and

291
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
loving is as unrealistic as expecting a woman

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
who's upset to immediately calm down and make

293
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
complete sense on the other hand men generally have

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
little awareness of how distant they become when they're in their cave

295
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
as a man recognizes how withdrawing into his cave may affect a woman

296
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
he can be more compassionate when she feels neglected and unimportant

297
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
to increase consideration both men and women need to understand each other

298
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
better when a man begins to ignore his wife she

299
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
often takes it personally knowing he's coping with stress in his

300
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
own way is extremely helpful but does not always help her alleviate

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the pain at such times she may feel the need to

302
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
talk about these feelings this is when it's important for the man

303
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to validate her feelings he needs to understand that she has a

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
right to talk about her feelings just as he has a right to withdraw into his cave

305
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and not talk if she doesn't feel understood then it's

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
difficult for her to release her hurt and accept his differences

307
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
when women talk about problems men usually

308
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
resist a man assumes she's talking with him about her problems because she's

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
holding him responsible the more problems the more he feels

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
blamed he doesn't realize that she's talking to

311
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
feel better a man doesn't know that she will appreciate it greatly if he will

312
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
just listen men become impatient when women talk

313
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
about problems in great detail he thinks that all the details are

314
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
necessary for him to find a solution to her problem

315
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
he struggles to find their relevance and becomes impatient

316
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the more details she gives the more he's frustrated while listening

317
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
his frustration is lessened if he can remember

318
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
that she is greatly benefiting by talking about the details

319
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
this is something important to her something a woman can do to make it a

320
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
little easier for a man is to let him know in advance the outcome of the story

321
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and then go back and give the details avoid keeping him in suspense

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
if a woman can remind a man that she just wants to talk about her problems

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and that he doesn't have to solve any of them

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it can help them to relax and just listen

325
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
centuries before the martians and venusians got together they've been

326
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
quite happy living in their separate worlds

327
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
then one day everything changed the martians and venusians suddenly became

328
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
depressed it was this depression that motivated

329
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
them eventually to come together understanding the secrets of their

330
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
transformation helps us today to recognize how men and women are

331
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
motivated in different ways with this new awareness you will be

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
better equipped to support your partner as well as get the support you need at

333
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
difficult and stressful times let's go back in time

334
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and pretend to witness what happened when the martians became depressed

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
everyone on the planet left the cities and went to their caves for a long time

336
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
they were stuck and couldn't come out until one day when a martian happened to

337
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
glimpse the beautiful venusians through his telescope

338
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the sight of these beautiful beings inspired the martians and they felt

339
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
their depression miraculously lift suddenly they felt needed

340
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
they came out of their caves and began building a fleet of spaceships to fly to

341
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
venus when the venusians became depressed

342
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
to feel better they formed circles and began talking with one another about

343
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
their problems but this didn't seem to relieve the

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
depression they stayed depressed for a long time

345
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
until through their intuition they experienced a vision

346
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
strong and wondrous beings the martians would be coming across the universe to

347
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
love serve and support them suddenly they

348
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
felt cherished their depression lifted

349
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and they happily began preparing for the arrival of the martians

350
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed

351
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished

352
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
these secrets of motivation are still applicable

353
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
when a man does not feel needed in a relationship

354
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
he gradually becomes passive and less energized

355
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
with each passing day he has less to give to the relationship

356
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
on the other hand when he feels trusted to do his best to fulfill her needs

357
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and appreciated for his efforts he is empowered and has more to give

358
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
when a woman doesn't feel cherished in a relationship she gradually becomes

359
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
overly responsible and exhausted from giving too much

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
on the other hand when she feels cared for and respected

361
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and special she is fulfilled and has more to give

362
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
when a man is in love he begins to care about another as much as himself

363
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
he experiences his partner's fulfillment as if it were his own

364
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
he can easily endure any hardship to make her happy because her happiness

365
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
makes him happy his struggles become easier

366
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
he is energized with a higher purpose most men are not only hungry to give

367
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
love but are starving for it their biggest problem is they don't know

368
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
what they're missing they rarely saw their fathers succeed in

369
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
fulfilling their mothers through giving when his relationships fail he finds

370
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
himself depressed and stuck in his cave he stops caring

371
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and then doesn't know why he's so depressed

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
at such times he asks himself what is it all for

373
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
why should i even bother he doesn't know that he has stopped

374
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
caring because he doesn't feel needed he doesn't realize that by finding

375
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
someone who needs him he can shake off his depression and be motivated again

376
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
not to be needed is a slow death for a man

377
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
most men have little awareness of how important it is to a woman

378
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
to feel supported by someone who cares women are happy when they believe their

379
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
needs will be met when a woman is upset she needs to feel

380
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
she's not alone she needs to feel loved and cherished

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
empathy understanding validation and compassion go a long way

382
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
to assist her in becoming more receptive and appreciative of his support

383
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
men mendel realized this because their martian instincts tell them it's best to

384
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
be alone when they're upset when she's upset out of respect he will

385
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
leave her alone or if he stays he makes matters worse by

386
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
trying to solve her problems he doesn't instinctively realize that

387
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
what she needs most is just someone to be there

388
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
someone to listen someone who cares

389
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
a woman's tendency to become overly responsible

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
relaxes as she remembers that she is worthy of

391
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
love she doesn't have to earn it

392
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
she can relax give less and receive more

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
she deserves it when a woman realizes she's been giving

394
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
too much she tends to blame her partner for her unhappiness

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
although she has not received what she deserves to improve her relationships

396
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
she needs to recognize how she contributed to the problem

397
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
when a woman gives too much she should not blame her partner solely for the

398
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
problem likewise a man who gives less should not

399
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
blame his partner for being negative or unreceptive to him blaming does not work

400
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
understanding trust

401
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
compassion acceptance and support are the solution

402
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
not blaming our partners when this situation occurs

403
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
instead of blaming his partner for being resentful

404
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
a man can be compassionate and offer his support even if she doesn't ask for it

405
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
listen to her even if at first it sounds like blame and help her to trust and

406
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
open up by doing little things for her to show

407
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
he cares instead of blaming a man for giving less

408
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
a woman can accept and forgive her partner's imperfections especially when

409
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
he disappoints her trust that he wants to give more but he

410
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
doesn't know how or he doesn't realize how important it

411
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
is and so he doesn't offer his support she can also encourage him to give more

412
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
by appreciating what he does do and continue to ask for his support

413
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
most important however a woman needs to recognize her boundaries of what she can

414
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
give without later resenting her partner

415
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
instead of giving more and expecting her partner to then even the score

416
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
she needs to keep it even by regulating how much she gives

417
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
setting limits and receiving are very scary for a woman

418
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
she is commonly afraid of needing too much and then being rejected or judged

419
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
or even abandoned deep inside her unconscious

420
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
she may hold the incorrect belief that she is unworthy of love

421
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
particularly if as a child she witnessed abuse or was directly abused then she's

422
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
even more vulnerable to feeling unworthy of love

423
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
hidden in the unconscious this feeling generates the fear of

424
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
needing others because she is afraid of not being

425
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
supported she unknowingly pushes away the support she needs

426
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
when a man receives the message that she doesn't trust him to fulfill her needs

427
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
then he feels immediately rejected and is turned off

428
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
her hopelessness and mistrust transform her valid needs

429
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
into desperate expressions of neediness and communicate to him the message that

430
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
she doesn't trust him to support her ironically men are primarily motivated

431
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
by being needed but are turned off by this kind of neediness

432
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
at such times a woman mistakenly assumes that having needs turned him off

433
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
when in truth it is her hopelessness desperation and mistrust that has done

434
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
so without recognizing that men need to be

435
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
trusted it is difficult and confusing for women to understand the difference

436
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
between needing

437
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and neediness needing

438
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is openly reaching out and asking for support from a man in a trusting manner

439
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
one that assumes that he will do his best

440
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
this empowers him neediness however is desperately needing

441
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
support because you don't trust you'll get it

442
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it pushes men away and makes them feel rejected and unappreciated

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
for women not only is needing others confusing but being disappointed or

444
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
feeling abandoned is especially painful even in the smallest ways

445
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
needing others puts her in a vulnerable position

446
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
being ignored or disappointed hurts more because it affirms the incorrect belief

447
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that she's unworthy when a woman realizes that she truly

448
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
deserves to be loved she's opening the door for a man to give

449
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to her but when it takes her ten years of over giving in a marriage to realize

450
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
that she deserves more ironically she feels like closing the door and not

451
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
giving him the chance when this is the case i have to assure

452
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
women that they don't have to give more to have a better relationship

453
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
their partner will actually give more if they give less

454
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
when a man has been ignoring her needs it's as though they have both been

455
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
asleep when she wakes up and remembers her

456
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
needs he also wakes up and wants to give her

457
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
more a man's deepest fear is that he's not

458
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
good enough or that he's incompetent

459
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
he compensates for this fear by focusing on increasing his power and

460
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
competence success achievement and efficiency are

461
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
foremost in his life just as a woman

462
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
is afraid around receiving men tend to be afraid around giving

463
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
to extend himself and giving to her means to risk failure

464
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
correction or even disapproval

465
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
these consequences are most painful because deep inside his unconscious he

466
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
may hold the incorrect belief that he's not good enough

467
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
this belief was formed and reinforced in childhood every time he thought he was

468
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
expected to do better ironically when a man really cares about

469
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
his partner his fear of failure increases

470
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and sometimes he gives less to avoid failure he stops giving to the

471
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
people he wants to give to the most he appears most uncaring when he's most

472
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
afraid the first step for man and learning how

473
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
to give is to realize that it's okay to make mistakes

474
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and it's okay to fail and that he doesn't have to have all the

475
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
answers the phrase i don't know isn't even in

476
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the martian dictionary

477
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
women commonly misinterpret a man's silence

478
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
depending upon how she's feeling that day she may begin to imagine the very

479
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
worst he hates me he doesn't love me

480
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
he's leaving me forever this may then trigger her deepest fear

481
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
which is i'm afraid if he rejects me then i will

482
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
never be loved i don't deserve to be loved

483
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
when a man is silent it's easy for a woman to imagine the

484
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
worst because the only times a woman would be silent

485
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
or when she had something to say that would be hurtful

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
or when she didn't want to talk to a person

487
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
because she didn't trust him anymore and wanted nothing to do with him

488
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
no wonder a woman becomes insecure when a man suddenly becomes quiet

489
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
women have a lot to learn about men before relationships can be really

490
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
fulfilling they need to learn that when a man is

491
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
upset or stressed he will automatically stop talking

492
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
go to his cave and work things out and no one is allowed in that cave

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
when a man goes to his cave women should not become scared that they have done

494
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
something terribly wrong they need to gradually learn that if you

495
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
just let a man go into his cave after a while he'll come out and

496
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
everything will be fine it is important for women not to try to

497
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
get a man to talk before he's ready women get burned not only when they

498
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
unknowingly invade a man's introspective time but also when they misinterpret his

499
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
expressions which are generally warnings that he is either in his cave or on his

500
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
way when asked what's the matter

501
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
a martian will say something brief like it's nothing

502
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
or i'm okay even when a man's out of the cave he

503
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
still needs to be trusted they don't like unsolicited advice or

504
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
empathy they need to prove themselves

505
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
a man feels supported when a woman communicates in a way that says

506
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
i trust you to handle things unless you directly ask for help

507
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
learning to support men in this way can be very difficult in the beginning

508
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
many women feel that the only way they can get what they need in a relationship

509
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
is to criticize a man when he makes mistakes or to offer unsolicited advice

510
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
if he behaves in a manner that she doesn't like

511
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
she can directly tell him that she doesn't like his behavior without

512
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
casting judgment that he is wrong or bad without an understanding of

513
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
how she may be turning the men off in her life with unsolicited advice or

514
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
criticism a woman feels powerless to get what she

515
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
needs or what she wants from a man

516
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
nancy was frustrated in her relationship she said

517
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
i still don't know how to approach a man with criticism and advice

518
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
no matter how i tell him he gets angry or defensive or just ignores me

519
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
the answer is she should not offer criticism or advice unless he asks

520
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
instead she should try giving him loving

521
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
acceptance this is what he needs not lectures

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
men need to feel very secure before they open up and ask for support

523
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
as we've discussed when a man goes into his cave

524
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
or becomes quiet he's saying i need some time to think about this

525
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
please stop talking to me i'll be back

526
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and then we can talk when he goes to his cave

527
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
a man doesn't realize that a woman may hear

528
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
i don't love you i can't stand to listen to you

529
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
i'm leaving and i'm never coming back to counteract this message he can learn

530
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
to say these four magic words

531
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
i will be back

532
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
i'll be back it's amazing how these simple words make

533
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
such a profound difference in addition he could say

534
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
i'll be back and then we can talk again good communication requires

535
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
participation on both sides a man needs to work at remembering that

536
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
complaining about problems does not mean he's being blamed

537
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
a woman can work at letting him know that though she's complaining sometimes

538
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
she also appreciates him or that she's not blaming him

539
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
for example while writing this chapter

540
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
my wife bonnie came in and asked how i was doing

541
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
i said good how's your day she said

542
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
oh there's so much to do we hardly have any time together anymore

543
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the old me would have become very defensive and reminded her of all the

544
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
time we have spent together or i would have told her how important

545
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
my deadline was this would have just created tension

546
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the newbie aware of our differences understood that she was just looking for

547
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
some reassurance and understanding and she wasn't looking for any

548
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
justifications or explanations i said

549
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you're right we've been really busy it's been a long day come here sit in my

550
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
lap let me give you a hug she then said

551
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
you feel really good this was the appreciation i needed in order to be

552
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
more available to her i then offered to drop off the

553
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
babysitter so she could relax before dinner

554
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
she said really you'll take the babysitter home that'd be great thanks

555
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
again she gave me the appreciation i needed to feel like a successful partner

556
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
even when she was tired and exhausted women don't always think of giving

557
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
appreciation because they assume a man knows how much

558
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
she appreciates being heard he doesn't know

559
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
he thinks he's doing nothing by listening

560
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
when she's talking about problems he needs to be reassured that he is still

561
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
loved and appreciated and that he's doing something

562
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
even though from his point of view he's doing nothing but listening

563
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
men feel frustrated by problems unless they're doing something to solve

564
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
them by appreciating him for being a good

565
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
listener a woman can let him know that just by

566
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
listening he is also helping a woman does not have to suppress her

567
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
feelings or even change them to support her partner

568
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
she does however need to express them in a way that doesn't make him feel

569
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
attacked accused are blamed making a few small changes can make a

570
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
big difference the four magic words to support a man

571
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
are it's not your fault

572
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
it's not your fault reassuring a man that it's not his fault

573
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
or that he's not being blamed works only as long as she truly is not

574
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
blaming him if she is attacking him then she should

575
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
share her feelings with somebody else she should wait until she's more loving

576
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
or centered to talk to him a man often blames a woman for being

577
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
blaming when she is innocently talking about problems

578
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
this is very destructive to the relationship because it blocks

579
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
communication a helpful approach is to remember that

580
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
she always has a right to be upset and that once she gets it out she will

581
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
feel much better as a man learns to listen and interpret

582
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
a woman's feelings correctly communication becomes easier

583
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
although listening is an important skill to practice

584
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
some days a man is too stressed or too sensitive to translate the intended

585
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
meaning of her phrases at such times

586
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
he should not even attempt to listen instead he could kindly say

587
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
this isn't a good time for me let's talk about it later i need some time alone

588
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
as bonnie and i have learned to communicate in a way that respects our

589
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
differences and understands our needs our marriage has become so much easier

590
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
i've witnessed this kind of transformation in thousands of

591
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
individuals and couples relationships thrive when communication

592
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
reflects a ready acceptance and a respect of

593
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
people's innate differences when misunderstandings arise remember

594
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
that we speak different languages take the time necessary to translate

595
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
what your partner really means or wants to say

596
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
this definitely takes practice but it's well worth it

597
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
men are like rubber bands when they pull away

598
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
they can stretch only so far before they come springing back

599
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
a rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle this

600
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
cycle involves getting close pulling away

601
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and then getting close again most women are surprised to realize that

602
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
even when a man loves a woman periodically he needs to pull away

603
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
before he can get closer men instinctively feel this urge to pull

604
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
away it's not a decision or even a choice it

605
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
just happens it's a natural cycle women misinterpret a man's pulling away

606
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
because generally speaking a woman pulls away for different reasons

607
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
she pulls back when she doesn't trust him to understand her feelings

608
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
when she's been hurt or she's afraid of being hurt again

609
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
or when he's done something wrong and disappointed her

610
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
certainly a man may pull away for the same reasons

611
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
but he will also pull away even if she's done nothing wrong

612
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
he pulls away to fulfill his need for independence or autonomy

613
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
when he is fully separated when he is pulled away

614
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
then suddenly he will feel his need for love and intimacy again

615
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
automatically he will be more motivated to give his love and receive back the

616
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
love he needs if understood this male intimacy cycle

617
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
enriches a relationship because it is misunderstood it creates

618
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
unnecessary problems let's explore an example

619
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
maggie was distressed anxious and confused

620
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
she and her boyfriend jeff had been dating for about six months

621
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
everything had been so romantic then without any apparent reason he

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
began to distance himself emotionally maggie couldn't understand why he had

623
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
suddenly pulled away she thought she'd done something wrong

624
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
after taking my seminar maggie realized that when jeff pulled

625
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
away it was not her fault in addition

626
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
she learned why he was pulling away and how to gracefully deal with it

627
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
months later at another seminar jeff thanked me for what maggie had learned

628
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
he told me they were now engaged to be married

629
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
maggie had discovered a secret about men that few women know

630
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
maggie realized that when she was trying to get close

631
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
while jeff was trying to pull away she was actually preventing him

632
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
from stretching his full distance and then springing back

633
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
by running after him she was preventing him from ever feeling that he needed her

634
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and wanted to be with her she realized that she had done this in

635
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
every relationship unknowingly she had obstructed an

636
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
important cycle by trying to maintain intimacy

637
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:07,000
she actually had prevented it [Music]

638
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
when a man has stretched away his full distance

639
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
he will return with a lot of power and spring

640
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
this is generally puzzling for a woman because for her

641
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
becoming intimate again requires a period of re-acquaintance

642
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
if she doesn't understand that men are different in this way

643
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
she may have a tendency to mistrust his sudden desire for intimacy and push him

644
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
away men also need to understand this

645
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
difference when a man springs back before a woman

646
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
can open up again to him she generally wants and needs time and

647
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
conversation to reconnect this transition can be more graceful if

648
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
a man understands a woman may need more time

649
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
especially if she felt hurt when he pulled away

650
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
without this understanding a man may become impatient

651
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
a man automatically alternates between needing intimacy and

652
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
autonomy for example in the beginning of his relationship

653
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
with maggie jeff was strong and full of desire

654
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
he wanted to impress her fulfill her please her get close to her

655
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
as she opened her heart to him he got closer and closer he felt wonderful

656
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
but after a brief period a change took place

657
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
even though this closeness is fulfilling to man he will inevitably begin to feel

658
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
the urge to pull away having temporarily fulfilled his hunger

659
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
for intimacy like after a good meal

660
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
he now feels his hunger to be independent

661
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
or to go for a walk as jeff instinctively pulls away without

662
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
any explanation to maggie maggie reacts with fear

663
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
she feels powerless to get him back because she doesn't know what she did to

664
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
turn him off when she asks him what's the matter he

665
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
doesn't have a clear answer and so he resists talking about it

666
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
he just continues to distance from her even more

667
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
without an understanding of this cycle it's easy to see how men and women begin

668
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
to doubt their love maggie could easily assume that jeff

669
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
didn't love her without getting a chance to pull away

670
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
jeff would lose touch with his desire and passion to be close

671
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
he could easily assume he no longer loved maggie

672
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
after learning to let jeff have his distance

673
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
or space maggie discovered that he did come back

674
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
she practiced not running after him when he would withdraw

675
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and trusted that everything was okay each time he did come back

676
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
as her trust in this process grew it became easier for her to accept this

677
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
part of jeff the more she just accepted him at those

678
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
times the sooner he would return as jeff began to understand his changing

679
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
feelings and needs he became more confident in his love for

680
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
her he was able to make a commitment without an understanding of how men are

681
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
like rubber bands it's very easy for women to misinterpret a man's

682
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
reactions when a man pulls away it's not because he doesn't want to talk

683
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
instead he needs some time alone time to be with himself when he's not

684
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
responsible for anybody else it's a time for him to take care of

685
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
himself when he returns then he's available to

686
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
talk to a certain extent a man loses himself

687
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
through connecting with his partner by feeling her needs

688
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
problems wants emotions he may lose touch with his own sense of

689
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
self pulling away allows him to re-establish

690
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
his personal boundaries and fulfill his need to feel autonomous

691
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
when a man is pulling away this is not the time to try to get

692
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
closer let him pull away

693
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
after some time he'll return he will appear loving and supportive

694
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and act as though nothing has happened this is the time to talk

695
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
not when he's pulling away men generally don't realize how they're

696
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
suddenly pulling away and then later returning affects women

697
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
with insight about this intimacy cycle a man can recognize the importance of

698
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
sincerely listening when a woman speaks he grows to understand his own cycles

699
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
and reassures her when he pulls away that he will be back

700
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
when he returns to talk she might probe him to understand why he left

701
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
if he's not sure which is many times the case he might say

702
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
i'm not sure i just needed some time to myself

703
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
to initiate a conversation the wise woman learns not to demand that a man

704
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
talk but asked that he truly listened to her

705
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
as her emphasis changes the pressure on him is released

706
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
she learns to open up and share her feelings without demanding that he do

707
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the same she trusts that he will gradually open

708
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
up more as he feels accepted and listens to her feelings

709
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
she does not punish him or chase after him

710
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
she understands that sometimes her intimate feelings trigger his need to

711
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
pull away while at other times when he's on his

712
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
way back he is quite capable of hearing her

713
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
intimate feelings

714
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
a woman is like a wave when she feels loved her self-esteem

715
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
rises and falls in a wave motion when she's feeling really good

716
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
she will reach a peak and then suddenly her mood may change

717
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and her wave crashes down this crash is temporary

718
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
after she reaches bottom suddenly her mood will shift and she

719
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
will again feel good about herself and the wave rises back up a woman's

720
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
self-esteem rises and falls like a wave

721
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
when she hits bottom it's a time for emotional house cleaning

722
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
a woman's ability to give and receive love in her relationships is generally a

723
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
reflection of how she's feeling about herself

724
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
when she's not feeling as good about herself she's unable to be as accepting

725
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and appreciative of her partner at her down times she tends to be

726
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
overwhelmed or more emotionally reactive when her wave hits bottom she's more

727
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
vulnerable and she needs more love it's as though she sinks down into a

728
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
well and in this well there are lots of

729
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
feelings and when they first come up they're not

730
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
clear it's crucial that her partner

731
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
understands what she needs at these times

732
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
otherwise he may make unreasonable demands

733
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
a man commonly assumes that her sudden change of mood

734
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
is based solely on his behavior when she is happy he takes credit but

735
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
when she is unhappy he also feels responsible

736
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
he may feel extremely frustrated because he doesn't know how to make things

737
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
better or he simply feels blamed mary and bill had been married for six

738
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
years bill had observed this wave pattern in

739
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
mary but because he didn't understand it he tried to fix it which made matters

740
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
worse bill said i can't understand my wife

741
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
mary for weeks she's the most wonderful woman

742
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
she gives her love unconditionally to me and to everyone

743
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
then suddenly she becomes overwhelmed by how much she's doing for everyone and

744
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
starts being very disapproving of me it's not my fault she's unhappy i

745
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
explain that to her and we just get into the biggest fights

746
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
like many men bill made the mistake of trying to

747
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
prevent his partner from bottoming out he tried to rescue her

748
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
he had not learned that she needed to hit bottom before she could come up

749
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
the last thing a woman needs when she's on her way down

750
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
is someone telling her why she shouldn't be down

751
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
what she needs is someone to be with her as she goes down

752
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
to listen to her for a while while she shares her feelings

753
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and to empathize with what she's going through

754
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
even if a man can't fully understand why a woman feels so overwhelmed

755
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
he can offer his love he can give her attention and certainly

756
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
support her after learning how women are like waves

757
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
bill was still confused the next time his wife seemed to be in

758
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
her well or the wave had crashed he practiced listening to her

759
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
he told me at first i listened and she seemed to open up and cheer more

760
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but then she started getting even more upset

761
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
it seemed the more i listened the more upset she got

762
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
i told her she shouldn't be getting more upset

763
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and then we got into a big argument although bill was listening to mary

764
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
he was still trying to fix her he expected her to feel better right

765
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
away what bill didn't know is that when a

766
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
woman goes into her whale if she feels supported she doesn't necessarily feel

767
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
better right away she may even feel worse

768
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
but that is a sign that his support may be helping

769
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
his support may actually help her to hit bottom sooner and then she can and she

770
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
will feel better to genuinely come up she first needs to

771
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
hit bottom that is the cycle

772
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
when a woman comes out of the well she becomes her usual loving self again

773
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
this positive shift is generally misunderstood by men

774
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
a man typically thinks that whatever was bothering her is now completely healed

775
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
or resolved this is not the case it's an illusion

776
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
when her wave crashes again similar issues will arise

777
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
when her issues come up again he becomes impatient because he thinks

778
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that they've already been resolved without understanding the wave

779
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
he finds it hard to validate and nurture her feelings

780
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
when she's feeling down or in the well when a woman goes into her well her

781
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
deepest issues tend to surface these issues may have to do with the

782
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
relationship but usually they are heavily charged

783
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
from her past relationships and childhood

784
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
whatever remains to be healed or resolved from her past inevitably will

785
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
come up as she feels more and more supported at

786
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
these difficult times she begins to trust the relationship

787
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and is able to journey in and out of her well without conflict in her

788
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
relationship or struggle in her life this is the blessing of a loving

789
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
relationship to support a woman when she's in her

790
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
well is a special gift that she will greatly

791
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
appreciate gradually she will become free from the

792
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
gripping influences of her past she will still have her ups and downs

793
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
but they will not be so extreme that they overshadow her loving nature

794
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
men and women generally are unaware that they have different emotional needs

795
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
as a result they don't instinctively know how to support each other

796
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
men typically given relationships what men want

797
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
while women give to men what women want each mistakenly assumes that the other

798
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
has the same needs and desires as a result

799
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
they both end up dissatisfied or resentful

800
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
both men and women feel that they give and give but they don't get back

801
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
they feel that their love is unacknowledged and unappreciated

802
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
the truth is they are both giving love but not in the

803
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
desired manner most of our complex emotional needs can

804
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
be summarized as the need for love men and women each have six unique needs

805
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
that are all equally important men primarily need trust

806
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
acceptance appreciation

807
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
admiration approval

808
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and encouragement women primarily need

809
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
caring understanding

810
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
respect devotion

811
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
validation and reassurance

812
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
certainly every man and woman ultimately needs all these 12 kinds of love

813
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
what is meant by primary need is that fulfilling a primary need is

814
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
required before one is able to receive and appreciate the other kinds of love

815
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
without an awareness of what is important for the opposite sex

816
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
men and women don't realize how much they may be hurting their partners are

817
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
depriving them of what they deserve women generally don't realize the ways

818
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
they communicate that are unsupportive and hurtful to the male ego

819
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
here's a list of three common mistakes women make in relation to a

820
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
man's primary love needs the first

821
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
she tries to improve his behavior or help him by offering unsolicited advice

822
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
he doesn't feel loved because she doesn't trust him

823
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
the second she doesn't acknowledge what he does for

824
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
her but complains about what he hasn't done

825
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
he feels taken for granted and unloved because she doesn't appreciate what he

826
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
does the third she corrects his behavior and tells him what to do as if he were a

827
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
child he feels unloved

828
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
because he doesn't feel admired through understanding a woman's primary

829
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
needs a man can be more sensitive to and respectful of her needs

830
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the following shows three mistakes men make in relation to a woman's primary

831
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
emotional needs the first

832
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
he minimizes the importance of her feelings and needs

833
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
he makes children her work more important

834
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
she feels unloved because he's not devoted to her and doesn't honor her as

835
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
special the second

836
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
he listens but then gets angry and blames her for upsetting him or for

837
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
bringing him down she feels unloved because he doesn't

838
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
respect her feelings the third after listening he says

839
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
nothing or just walks away she feels insecure because she didn't

840
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
get the reassurance she needs many people give up when relationships

841
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
become too difficult relationships become easier when we

842
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
understand our partner's primary needs without giving more but by giving what

843
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
is required we don't burn out

844
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
to fulfill your partner you need to learn how to give the love he or she

845
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
primarily needs

846
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
of the most difficult challenges in our loving relationships is handling

847
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
differences in disagreements just as communication is the most

848
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
important element in a relationship arguments can be the most destructive

849
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
element because the closer we are to someone

850
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
the easier it is to bruise or to be bruised

851
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
for all practical purposes i strongly recommend that couples not argue

852
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
negotiate yes ask what you want express differences but don't argue or

853
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
fight it is possible to be honest open and

854
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
even express negative feelings without arguing or fighting

855
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
by remembering that we're from different planets

856
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and developing good communication skills it's possible to avoid arguments

857
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
without suppressing negative feelings or even conflicting ideas and desires

858
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
it takes two to argue that only takes one to stop an argument

859
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
the best way to stop an argument is to nip it in the bud

860
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
stop talking and take a timeout reflect on how you're approaching your

861
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
partner try to understand how you're not giving

862
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
them what they need then after some time has passed come

863
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
back talk again but in a more loving and

864
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
respectful way time timeouts

865
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
allow us to cool off heal our wounds

866
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
center ourselves before trying to communicate again

867
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
men and women commonly argue about money sex decisions scheduling

868
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
values child rearing

869
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
household responsibilities these discussions and negotiations

870
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
however turn into painful arguments for only one reason

871
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
we're not feeling loved because women are not from mars

872
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
they don't instinctively realize that conflicting ideas and feelings and

873
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
desires are a difficult challenge for a man

874
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
the closer he is to a woman the harder it is to deal with differences and

875
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
disagreements when she doesn't like something he's

876
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
done he feels she doesn't like him

877
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
fulfilling a man's primary emotional needs will diminish his tendency to

878
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
engage in hurtful arguments automatically he'll be able to listen

879
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and speak with much greater respect understanding and caring

880
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
most arguments escalate when a man begins to invalidate a

881
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
woman's feelings and she responds to him disapprovingly

882
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
when a man has done something to upset a woman his instinct is to explain to her

883
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
why she shouldn't be upset but when he explains himself

884
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
the only message she may hear

885
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
is that he doesn't care about her feelings

886
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
for her to hear his good reasons she first needs him to hear her good

887
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
reasons for being upset he needs to put his explanations on hold

888
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and listen to her understanding her point of view

889
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
when he simply starts to care about her feelings

890
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
she will start to feel supported remember women need to feel cared for

891
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
men need to feel trusted this change in approach takes practice

892
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
but can be achieved generally when a woman expresses

893
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
feelings of frustration disappointment or worry

894
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
every cell in a man's body instinctively reacts with a list of explanations and

895
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
justifications designed to explain away her upset feelings

896
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
a man never intends to make matters worse

897
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
his tendency to explain away feelings is just martian instinct

898
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the most common way women unknowingly start arguments is by

899
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
not being direct when they share their feelings

900
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
for example when a man is laid a woman may feel i

901
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
don't like waiting for you when you're late

902
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
or i was worried that something had happened to you

903
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
however when he arrives instead of directly sharing her feelings

904
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
she tends to ask rhetorical questions like

905
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
how could you be so late or why didn't you call

906
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
when a man hears a question like why didn't you call

907
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
he feels attacked and becomes defensive she has no idea of how painful her

908
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,000
disapproval in that moment is to him just as women need validation

909
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
men need approval most men are ashamed to admit how much

910
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
they need approval they may go to great lengths to prove

911
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
they don't care but why do they immediately become cold

912
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
distant and defensive when they lose a woman's approval

913
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
because not getting what they need hurts

914
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
one of the reasons relationships are so successful in the beginning is that a

915
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
man receives approval and rides high but as soon as he begins to disappoint

916
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
he's cast out into the dog house to treat a man as if he has no good

917
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
reason for what he does is to withhold the approval she so freely gave at the

918
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
beginning of the relationship a woman needs to remember

919
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
that she can still give approval even when she disagrees

920
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
every relationship has difficult times they may occur for a variety of reasons

921
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
like loss of a job death illness

922
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
or just not enough rest at these times the most important thing

923
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
is to try to communicate with a loving validating and approving attitude

924
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
in addition we need to accept and understand that we and our partners will

925
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
not always be perfect by learning successfully to communicate

926
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
in response to the smaller upsets in a relationship

927
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
it becomes easier to deal with the bigger challenges when they suddenly

928
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
appear

929
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
when we are upset or angry it is difficult to communicate lovingly

930
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
at such times even with the best intentions

931
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
talking turns into fighting in the heat of the moment we don't

932
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
remember how to communicate in a way that works for our partner or for us

933
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
at times like these women unknowingly tend to blame men and make them feel

934
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
guilty for their actions instead of remembering that her partner

935
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
is doing the best he can a woman could assume the worst and sound

936
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
critical and resentful when she feels a surge of negative

937
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
feelings it is especially difficult for a woman to speak in a trusting accepting

938
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and appreciative way she doesn't realize how negative and

939
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
hurtful her attitude is to her partner when men become upset they tend to

940
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
become judgmental of a woman and her feelings

941
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
instead of remembering that his partner is vulnerable and sensitive

942
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
a man tends to forget her needs and sound mean and uncaring

943
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
when he feels a surge of negative feelings it's especially difficult for

944
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
him to speak in a caring understanding and respectful way he

945
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
doesn't realize how hurtful his negative attitude is to her

946
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
these are the times when talking doesn't work

947
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
fortunately there is another alternative

948
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
instead of verbally sharing your feelings with your partner write her or

949
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
him a letter writing letters allows you to listen to

950
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
your own feelings without worrying about hurting your partner

951
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
by freely expressing and listening to your own feelings

952
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
you automatically become more centered and loving

953
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
writing out your negative feelings is an excellent way to become aware of how

954
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
unloving you may sound because many times we don't realize how

955
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
unloving we sound with this greater awareness you can

956
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
adjust your approach it's easier in addition

957
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
by writing out your negative emotions their intensity can be released or at

958
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
least minimized making room for positive feelings to be

959
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
felt again having become more centered you can then

960
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
go to your partner and speak to him or to her in a more loving way

961
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
a way that's less judgmental or blaming as a result your chances of being heard

962
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and understood of being accepted are much greater

963
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
instead of writing down your feelings you may also choose to do the same

964
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
process in your mind imagine in your mind you are saying what

965
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
you feel think and want without editing yourself

966
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
by carrying on an inner dialogue expressing the complete truth about your

967
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
feelings you will suddenly become free from their

968
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
negative grip one of the best ways to release

969
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
negativity and then communicate in a more loving fashion

970
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000

to create some intimacy she brought a mango into the bedroom and

offered him some jim was preoccupied reading a book in

1006

bed and briefly commented that he wasn't hungry

1007
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
virginia felt rejected and left instead of coming back and complaining

1008
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
about his rudeness and insensitivity she wrote a love letter

1009
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
after writing this letter virginia feeling more accepting and

1010

directly in getting her partner's attention

book and this is our last evening together before you leave

1019
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
i'm angry that you ignore me i'm angry that you don't want to spend

1020
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000

1023
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,000
i don't feel special level three fear

1024
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
i'm afraid you don't even care i'm afraid you don't like me

1025
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
level four regret i feel so embarrassed wanting to spend

1026
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:13,000
time with you when you don't even care i feel embarrassed getting so upset

1027
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
i'm sorry if this sounds demanding i'm sorry i stopped trusting your love

1028
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and level five love

1029
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
i do love you that's why i brought the mango

1030
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
i wanted to spend some special time together

1031
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
i forgive you for being so indifferent to me

1032
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
i understand that you were in the middle of reading something

1033
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
let's have a loving and intimate evening i love you

1034
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
virginia p.s

1035
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
the response i would like to hear

1036
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
i love you virginia and i always want to spend a loving evening with you

1037
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
i'm going to miss you

1038
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
writing a response letter is the second step in the love letter technique

1039
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
once you've expressed both your negative and positive feelings

1040
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
taking an additional three to five minutes to write a response letter

1041
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
can be a healing process in this response letter

1042
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
you will write the kind of response you would like to have from your partner

1043
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
imagine your partner is able to respond to your hurt feelings

1044
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
the ones you expressed in your love letter

1045
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
write a short letter to yourself pretending it is your partner writing it

1046
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
to you include all the things you would like to

1047
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
hear from your partner about the hurts you've expressed

1048
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
the following lead-in phrases can get you started

1049
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
remember this is a letter you're writing but pretending they're saying it to you

1050
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
use these kinds of phrases thank you for i understand

1051
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
i'm sorry you deserve

1052
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
i want i love

1053
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
sometimes writing a response letter is even more powerful than writing the love

1054
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
letter writing out what we actually need

1055
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
increases our openness to receiving the support we deserve

1056
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
in addition when we imagine our partners

1057
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
responding lovingly we actually make it easier for them to do so

1058
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
some people are very good at writing out their negative feelings but have a hard

1059
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
time finding the feelings of love it's especially important for these

1060
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
people to write a response letter and explore

1061
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
what they would want to hear in return be sure to feel your own resistance

1062
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
about letting your partner support you this gives you an added awareness about

1063
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
how difficult it must be for your partner to deal lovingly with

1064
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
you at such times sometimes women object to writing

1065
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
response letters they expect their partners to know what

1066
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
to say they have a hidden feeling that says

1067
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
i don't want to tell him what i need if he really loves me he'll know

1068
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
in this case a woman needs to remember that men are from mars

1069
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and they really don't know what women need

1070
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
they need to be told and gradually over time they'll learn

1071
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
sometimes women ask me if i tell him what i want to hear

1072
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and he starts saying it how do i know he's not just saying it

1073
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
i'm afraid he might not really mean it this is an important question

1074
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
if a man doesn't love a woman he will not even bother to give her what she

1075
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
needs if he even attempts to give a response

1076
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
similar to her request then most likely he is really trying to

1077
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
respond if in the beginning he doesn't sound

1078
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
fully sincere it's because he's learning something new

1079
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
it's awkward learning a new way of responding is

1080
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
awkward to him it may feel weak

1081
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
this is a critical time he needs lots of appreciation and encouragement he needs

1082
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
feedback telling him he's on the right sharing your love letters is important

1083
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
for the following reasons it gives your partner an opportunity to

1084
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
support you it allows you to get the understanding

1085
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
you need it helps couples to start talking again

1086
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
when communication breaks down and it teaches us how to hear negative

1087
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
feelings in a safe way

1088
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
to receive more love we need to have people in our life with whom we can

1089
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
openly and safely share our feelings a loving and supportive group can do

1090
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
wonders to help us more easily get in touch with

1091
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
our deeper feelings to share your feelings with a group

1092
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
means there are more people available to give you love

1093
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
i hope you will use this love letter technique because i've witnessed it

1094
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
transform the lives of thousands of people including my own

1095
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
as you write more love letters it becomes easier and works better it takes

1096
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
practice but it's worth it when you want to feel better

1097
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
write a love letter

1098
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
if you're not getting the support you want in your relationships

1099
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
a significant reason may be that you don't ask enough

1100
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
or you may ask in a way that doesn't work

1101
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
asking for love and support is essential to the success of any relationship

1102
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
if you want a g-e-t then you have to ask

1103
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
if you want to get more you have to ask more

1104
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
both men and women have difficulty in asking for support

1105
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
women however tend to find it much more frustrating and disappointing to ask for

1106
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
support than men do on venus their motto is

1107
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,000
love is never having to ask she may even purposefully not ask as a

1108
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:05,000
test to see if he really loves her to pass the test she requires that he

1109
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
anticipate her needs and offer his unsolicited support

1110
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
this approach to relationships with men doesn't work

1111
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
men are from mars and on mars if you want more support you

1112
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
simply have to ask for it in the beginning of a relationship if a

1113
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
woman doesn't get the support she wants she then assumes he's not giving because

1114
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
he has nothing more to give she patiently and lovingly continues to

1115
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
give to him assuming that sooner or later he'll

1116
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
catch up he assumes however

1117
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
he is giving enough because she continues to give to him

1118
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
eventually she may ask for his support but by this time she is given so much

1119
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
more and feels so much resentment that her

1120
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
request is really a demand

1121
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
men do not respond well to demands and resentment

1122
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
even if a man is willing to give support her resentment or demands

1123
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
will lead him to say no demands are complete turn off

1124
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
the first step is to practice asking for your already getting

1125
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
become aware of what your partner is already doing for you especially the

1126
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
little things begin asking him to do the little things

1127
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
he already does then when he does these little things

1128
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
give him a lot of appreciation in this first stage don't expect him to

1129
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
offer his support it's important not to ask for more than

1130
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
what he's used to giving allow them to become used to hearing you ask for

1131
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,000
things in a non-demanding tone just as a woman who is upset

1132
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
doesn't want to hear a list of reasons and explanations about why she shouldn't

1133
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
be upset a man doesn't want to hear a list of

1134
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
reasons about why he should fulfill her request

1135
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
simply be direct an indirect request makes a man feel

1136
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
taken for granted or even controlled one of the most common mistakes in

1137
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
asking for support is the use of the words could you

1138
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
or can you in place of would you will you

1139
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
to a man it makes a big difference if you say could you empty the trash versus

1140
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
would you empty the trash to him he'd much prefer to hear would

1141
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
you empty the trash the hardest thing of learning to ask is

1142
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
remembering how to do it try using the w words whenever possible

1143
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
it will take a lot of practice be direct

1144
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
be brief and use would you

1145
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
or will you phrases be aware of how many times you don't ask

1146
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
for support become aware of how you ask and when you

1147
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
do remember to be brief and direct

1148
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
then give him lots of appreciation and thanks

1149
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
don't let anything be taken for granted when he's used to hearing you ask for

1150
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
his support without wanting more he feels loved in your presence

1151
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
he feels he doesn't have to change to get your love

1152
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
at this point you can now risk asking for more

1153
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
let him realize that he can say no and still receive your love

1154
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
when he feels that he can say no when you ask for more

1155
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
he will feel free to say yes or no keep in mind

1156
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that men are much more willing to say yes if they have the freedom to say no

1157
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
once you can graciously accept a no you are ready to assert your full power to

1158
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
get what you want you ask for his support

1159
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and if he starts making excuses and resists your request

1160
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,000
you don't say okay in this third stage you practice making it okay that he

1161
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
resists but continue waiting for him to say yes

1162
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
the art of assertive asking is to remain silent after you've made a

1163
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
request after you've asked

1164
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
expect him to moan or groan or scowl or growl or mumble or grumble

1165
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
i call all of these the grumbles when a man grumbles it's a good sign

1166
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
it means he's trying to consider your request versus his

1167
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
needs you may be asking yourself why men are so sensitive about being asked for

1168
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
support it's not because men are lazy but

1169
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
because men have a greater need to feel accepted

1170
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
any request to be more or to give more makes him feel that he's not accepted

1171
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
just the way is by learning to ask correctly for support

1172
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
in the martian way you not only help him to feel more loved

1173
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,000
but you also ensure that you'll get the love you need and deserve

1174
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
one of the paradoxes of loving relationships is that when things are

1175
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
going well and we're feeling loved we may suddenly find ourselves

1176
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
emotionally distancing from our partners or reacting to them in unloving ways

1177
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
it's surprising one day you're loving patient accepting

1178
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and then the next day you become demanding or dissatisfied

1179
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
your partner does something loving for you

1180
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and you find yourself resenting them for all the times in the past when he or she

1181
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
ignored you or

1182
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
you're attracted to your partner and then when he or she makes a commitment

1183
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
you lose your attraction or you find others more attractive

1184
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
you feel good about yourself or your life and then suddenly you begin feeling

1185
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
unworthy or abandoned or inadequate

1186
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
these sudden shifts are confusing yet they're common

1187
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
if we don't understand why they happen we may think we're going crazy

1188
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
or we may mistakenly conclude our love has

1189
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
died fortunately there's an explanation

1190
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,000
love brings up our unresolved feelings whenever we're loving ourselves more or

1191
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
being loved by others repressed feelings tend to come up

1192
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
they come up to be healed and released if we can successfully deal with those

1193
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
feelings then we can feel much better and enliven

1194
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
more of our creative and loving potential

1195
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:37,000
if however we get into a fight and blame our partner instead of healing our past

1196
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
we just get upset and then suppress the feelings again

1197
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
for years we have suppressed our painful feelings

1198
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
then one day we fall in love and love makes us feel safe enough to become

1199
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
aware of those feelings love opens us up and we start to feel

1200
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
our pain when a man's past comes up he generally

1201
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
heads for his cave he tends to be overly sensitive and

1202
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
needs a lot of acceptance a lot of space when a woman's past comes up her

1203
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
self-esteem crashes she descends into her well of feelings

1204
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
and she needs a lot of tender loving care

1205
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
this insight helps you to control your feelings when they come up

1206
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
understanding how the feelings of the past come up

1207
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
gives us a greater understanding of why our partners react the way they

1208
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
do it's part of the healing process

1209
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
as you grow more intimate in your relationships love increases

1210
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,000
as a result deeper more painful feelings may come up that need to be healed

1211
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
deep feelings like shame and fear

1212
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
to heal them we need to share them but we're too afraid to reveal what

1213
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
we're feeling at such times we may feel depressed

1214
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
anxious bored

1215
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
resentful or simply exhausted for no apparent reason

1216
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
these are all symptoms of our stuff coming up

1217
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
and being blocked when deep feelings come up we project

1218
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
our feelings onto our partner it is a paradox

1219
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
because you feel safe with your partner your deepest fears have a chance to

1220
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
surface when they surface you become afraid

1221
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and unable to share what you feel when this happens the feelings that are

1222
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
coming up get stuck this is why people with even very loving

1223
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
relationships may inevitably need the help of a

1224
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
therapist understanding how our past continues to

1225
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
affect our relationships frees us to accept the ebb and flow of

1226
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
love to be successful in our relationships we

1227
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
must accept that sometimes our hearts are full

1228
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and at other times empty we must not expect our partners to

1229
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
always be loving or even to remember how to be loving

1230
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
we must also give ourselves the gift of understanding and not expect to remember

1231
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
everything we've learned about being loving

1232
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
the process of learning requires not only hearing and applying but also

1233
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
forgetting and then remembering again throughout this tape you've learned

1234
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
things your parents could not teach you they did not know

1235
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
but now that you do know please be realistic

1236
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
give yourself permission to keep making mistakes give your partner permission to

1237
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
keep making mistakes integrating this new wisdom of having

1238
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
loving relationships is a new challenge you are a pioneer

1239
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
expect to be lost sometimes expect your partner to be lost

1240
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
use this guide as a map to lead you through uncharted lands

1241
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
again and again next time you're frustrated with the

1242
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
opposite sex remember

1243
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
men are from mars and women are from venus

1244
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
even if you don't remember anything else from this tape

1245
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
remembering that we're supposed to be different

1246
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
will help you to be more loving by gradually releasing your judgments

1247
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and blame and persistently asking for what you

1248
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
want you can create the loving relationships

1249
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
you want need and deserve you have a lot to look forward to

1250
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
may you continue to grow in love and light

1251
01:31:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
